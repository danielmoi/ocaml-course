# Basic Data Types

2 important primitive types of OCaml: integers and booleans.

## Type inference
Types of identifiers are inferred, not declared.
- a distinguishing feature of OCaml
- reconciles the flexibility of untyped languages with the safety of typed
  languages
- a very rich type system
- polymorphic types provide additional flexibility

## A Rich Type System
- basic types: int, bool, float, string, char

## Integers
- type: int
- values: -2^62 ... 2^62 - 1 (on 64-bit architectures, much less in exercise
  env)
- arithmetic operators: + - / *
  - / is integer division
  - 7/2 == 3
- calculations performed modulo
  - used as an infix operator
  - mod is integer remainder
  - 7 mod 2 = 1

------------------------------------------------------------
## Booleans
- type: bool
- values: true and false
- boolean operators:
  - && = conjunction
  - || = disjunction
  - not = negation
- comparison operators: <, >, <=, >=
- comparisons are only allowed between two VALUES of the same type
  - false || true
  - 5 < "hello" = nup

## Simple integer expressions

10 / 3 * 3
- 3 * 3
- 9

The / and * operators are left associative.
It means that this expression is read as: (10 / 3) * 3.

The / operator is the integer division.



42 + 73 mod 5 * 2
- 42 + 3 * 2
- 42 + 6
- 48
The mod operator computes the rest of the integer division. It is one of
  the rare infix operators composed only of alpha-numerical characters. It has a
  higher priority than other arithmetic operators, and this expression is read
  as: 42 + ((73 mod 5) * 2).

11 / 4 * 4 + 11 mod 4
- 11 / 4 * 4 + 3
- 3 * 4 + 3
- 12 + 3
- 15

------------------------------------------------------------
## Simple Boolean Expressions
not false || true
- true || true
- true

Function applications have a greater priority than arithmetic operators; this is
read as (not false) || true.

<> = negative of (=)
- the INEQUALITY operator
- the != operator exists, but has a different meaning

1 < 2 && 2 <> 3
- true && true
- true

1 = true
- type error
- While the comparison operators are polymorphic, you cannot compare two values
  of different types. Hence, the expressions true = 1 is rejected by the
  typechecker.

1 < 2 < 3
- The comparison operators are left associative. It means that this expression
  is syntactically valid, and is read as: (1 < 2) < 3.This is not a ternary
  comparison, which OCaml does not have. Although this pattern can make sense in
  some cases, it is here the result of a (common) beginner error. Fortunately,
  the typechecker rejects this expression, because the polymorphic comparison
  cannot compare two values of different types, namely 1 < 2 of type bool and 3
  of type int.
