# More Data Types

## Floating Point Arithmetic

- type: float
- values: must be written with:
  - decimal point (5.2)
  - exponential (5e3)
  - or both
- operations: +., -., *., /.
  - must be written with a DOT (.)
- functions: sqrt, sin, cos, ceil, floor

3.0 +. 0.01
- 3.01

3.0 +. 0.;;
- 3.;;




## Conversion between types
- basic types are DISJOINT: no value belongs to 2 different basic types
- no implicit conversion between types
- explicit conversion operations
- backround: implicit conversion would not go well with TYPE INFERENCE

## Conversion: Float <-> Integer
- conversion functions in both directions
  - float_of_int: int -> float
  - int_of_float: float -> int
  - "of" ~ "from"
  - function application
    - write the
      - name of the function
      - follow by the argument
    - parentheses only when necessary to indicate structure of a more complicated expression
    - more on functions later

## Characters
- type: char
- values: 256 characters, numbered from 0 to 155
- characters use SINGLE QUOTES
- can be written as 'a' '\087'
  - \087 is a character constant
- conversion functions
  - Char.chr: int -> char
    - "chr" is a letter / character
  - Char.code: char -> int
    - "code" is a number
  - these come from a module called "Char"


Char.code 'A';;
- 65

Char.chr 65;;
- 'A'

------------------------------------------------------------
## Strings
- type: string
- values: Character strings, like "Hello, World!"
  - string constants are written between DOUBLE quotes
- operator ^ for string concatenation
  - the "caret"
- many functions:
  - String.length : string -> int
  - int_of_string : string -> int
  - float_of_string : string -> float
- strings use DOUBLE QUOTES
  - so we know "ABC" is a string
  - and 'a' is a char

------------------------------------------------------------
## Char and String pitfalls
- strings, characters, int, bool, floats are ALL DISJOINT
- must use explicit conversion
- positions in string are numbered from 0 to its length minus 1
- strings used to be mutable, now they are NOT


"abc" ^ "def";;
- abcdef

String.length "12345"
- 5

int_of_string "12345"
- 12345

string_of_int 12345
- "12345"

String.get "abcdef" 1;;
- char = "b"

------------------------------------------------------------
## Quiz
1.5 *. 1000.;;
- 1500.
NOTE the trailing .

The expression `1000` used without a final dot is an INTEGER CONSTANT
- it cannot be used as an argument for a floating-point multiplication (ie. `*.`)

1000.+.500./.2.;;
- 1250.
- spacing has no influence on operator priorities

int_of_float 1500.1
- 1500

------------------------------------------------------------
Floor : float -> float

------------------------------------------------------------
not 1. = 2. || not 3 = 4

NOT READ AS THIS: not (1. = 2.) || not (3 = 4)

READ AS THIS: (not 1.) = 2. || (not 3) = 4
- type error



"Alphabet" < "Gammadelt";;
- the comparison of strings is based on ASCII-alphanumerical order


- 10. /. 3.;;
- : float = 3.33333333333333348
- so, 10. /. 3. *. 3.
- is 10
