# A Small Typed Database

A database for a contact list with 3 kinds of queries:
- insert
- delete
- search

The database engine is a FUNCTION of type:

database -> query -> status * database * contact

- ie. it returns a TRIPLE

- the status will be TRUE if the query went well

```ocaml
type phone_number = int * int * int * int;;

type contact = {
  name: string;
  phone_number: phone_number;
}

let nobody = {
  name: "";
  phone_number = (0 , 0, 0, 0);
}

type database = {
  number_of_contacts: int;
  contacts: contact array;
}

let make max_number_of_contacts = {
  number_of_contacts = 0;
  contacts = Array.make max_number_of_contacts nobody;
}

type query = {
  code: int;
  contact: contact;
}

let search db contact =
  let rec aux index =
    if index >= db.number_of_contacts then
      (false, db, nobody)
    else if db.contacts.(index).name = contact.name then
      (true, db, db.contacts.(index))
    else
      aux (index + 1)
  in
  aux 0;;

let insert db contact =
  if db.number_of_contacts = Array.length db.contacts - 1
    then
      (false, db, nobody)
  else
    let (status, db, _) = search db contact in
    if status then (false, db, contact)
    else
      let cells i =
      if i = db.number_of_contacts then contact
      else db.contacts.(i)
    in
      let db' = {
        number_of_contacts = db.number_of_contacts + 1
        contacts = Array.init (Array.length db.contacts) cells
      }
      in
      (true, db', contact);;

let delete db contact =
  let (status, db, contact) = search db contact in
  if not status then (false, db, contact)
  else
    let cells i =
      if db.contacts.(i).name = contact.name
        then nobody
        else db.contacts.(index) in
        let db' = {
          number_of_contacts = db.number_of_contacts - 1;
          contacts = Array.init (Array.length db.contacts) cells;
        }
    in
    (true, db', contact);;

let engine db (code, contact) =
  if code = 0 then insert db contact
  else if code = 1 then delete db contact
  else if code = 2 then search db contact
  else (false, db, nobody)

let db = make 5;;

let (status, db, contact) =
  engine db (0, {
    name = 'luke';
    phone_number = (1, 2, 3, 4);
  });;


```

That was a purely functional database engine
- a "non-destructive" program
  database -> query -> status * database * contact
- a NEW database is created EACH TIME a query is processed
- hence, previous versions of the database are still valid (?)

- in imperative programming, applying a query would modify the database instead...


This is a purely functional program.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Purely functional programs
- Side effects considered harmful

- FP encourages a style in which functions produce values,
  instead of modifying the memory, as in imperative programming


- what you get is this: The evaluation of a function does NOT
  depend on the STATE of the program, but only on its ARGUMENTS
- just like in mathematics!

- if you call a function multiple times, with the same inputs,
  you will get the same outputs

- mathematical specification can therefore be used on FP

- for instance, for all database d and for all contact c,
  if insert db c = (true, db', _)
  then search db' c = (true, db', c)

- this is because it does not depend on the STATE of the machine
- a FP can be used anytime

- it is more COMPOSABLE than an imperative one

------------------------------------------------------------
## Weaknesses of our implementation (our toy database)
- imprecise typing of query results
  - search queries return a contact
  - but insertion queries return a new database
  - the type of engine forces us to use a single type of query results

- we would LIKE to be able to have the type of an engine results as
  being the UNION of query result types (a contact / database)

- inefficient DUPLICATION of databases
  - each time a contact is inserted, the database is duplicated!
  - we should use a data structure that ENABLES more sharing

- forthcoing ALGEBRAIC DATATYPES will be an elegant answer to
  all these problems!
