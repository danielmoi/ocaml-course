# User-defined types

A value of a primitive type can be used to ENCODE some specific data.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Type as documentation
Example:
```
day = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} âŠ‚ int
```

A type identifier carries an INFORMAL VARIANT

Example: an integer is a valid day if 0 <= x <= 6

Then we can use a type identifier:

is_week_end : day -> bool

instead of: is_week_end : int -> bool

informally means that integers between 0 and 6 are the only valid inputs for
this function.

------------------------------------------------------------
```ocaml
type color = int;;

(* let's declare some colors! *)
let red : color = 0;;
let white : color = 1;;
let blue : color = 2;;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
```ocaml
type positive = int;;

(* here, we assigning a type to the subexpression *)
let abs (x : int) = (if x < 0 then -x else x : positive);;

(* we can also assign a type to the return of a function *)
(* the "return type" *)
let abs' (x: int) : positive = if x < 0 then -x else x;;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Syntax to declare a type

To declare a type: type some_type_identifier = some_type

This new TYPE IDENTIFIER (some_type_identifier) is a SYNONYM or ABBREVIATION for
some_type

Type identifiers must start with a lowercase letter

For now, we will only use the primitive types that we know: int, bool, string.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Syntax to annotate with a type
1. To annotate an IDENTIFIER with a type

```ocaml
let x : some_type = some_expression
```

This constrains an identifier to be of a certain type.

2. To annotate a FUNCTION ARGUMENT with a type:
```ocaml
let f (x : some_type) = some_expression
```

3. To constrain the RETURN TYPE of a function:
- do it just before the equals sign
```ocaml
let f x : some_type = some_expression
```

4. To constrain the type of an expression
```ocaml
let f x = (some_expression : some_type)
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## In the machine
- Type annotations have no impact on the program execution

- This is because types are static

```ocaml
type t = int;;
```

and x be a value of type int, then x is also of type int.

Hence, a value of type t is represented as a value of type int in the machine...

------------------------------------------------------------
## Pitfalls: Multiple type definitions
- in the REPL, be careful with unintended hiding of type identifiers
- The errors may be hard to understand

```ocaml
type t = int;;

let x : t = 0;;

(* we are re-using the same name as one of our previous type definitions *)
type t = bool;;

let f (x: t) = not x;;

let z = f x;;

(* Error: This expression has type t/1016 = int
but an expression was expected of type t/1018 = bool *)
- x is typed with the first type t (int)
- but f is typed with the second type t (bool)
- OCaml shows us the version that it is using internally to distinguish these 2 types
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Pitfalls: Limitations of type synonyms
- More a semantic error
- Consider type positive = int

- the type "positive" is only a documentation
- currently, there is no more static guarantee about positivity than 'int'

- this is valid: let x : positive = -1

- Alternatively, OCaml provides many ways to define more PRECISE TYPES in order
  to capture those kinds of properties, statically

------------------------------------------------------------
## Quiz: Syntax for type abbreviations

let f (x : string) : char = String.get x 0;;


This is valid:
```ocaml
# let f (bool: bool) = bool;;
val f : bool -> bool = <fun>
```
