# OCaml Features

Safety: from strong static typing and pattern matching

Conciseness: from polymorphic typing and type inference

Expressiveness: from higher order functions

## Lists

[] list
a::l = as list having a as the irst element, and the list l as rest

## Type inference

Sum elements of an integer list (suml) = "sum list"

We use pattern matching to define the actual use cases

```ocaml
let rec suml =
function
<!-- IF we are given an empty list, then the result is zero -->
  [] -> 0

  (* ELSE, if it has the shape of a first element "a" and the rest *)
  | a::rest -> a + (suml rest);;

```
We did not need to declare any type in our code.

Yet, the OCaml type checker INFERS the type for us:

val suml : int list -> int = <fun>

- you defined a value "suml"
- this is actually a function that takes an integer list, and returns an integer

------------------------------------------------------------
## Strong static typing
- all types are computed and enforced at compile time
- NOT at EXECUTION time

- Well typed programs cannot go wrong. Robin Milner

------------------------------------------------------------
## Polymorphic types, and higher order
Let's generalize our function: 0 and + can be made into parameters

op => +
e = 0

```ocaml
let rec fold op e =
function
  [] -> e
| a::rest -> op a (fold op e rest);;
```

Again, we did not need to type

val fold: ('a -> 'b -> 'b) -> 'b -> 'a list -> 'b = <fun>

The OCaml type checker inferes a GENERAL TYPE for us.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Polymorphism at work

```ocaml
fold ( + ) 0 [1;2;3;4;5];;

fold ( * ) 1 [1;2;3;4;5];;

fold ( ‚ÅÄ ) "" ["1";"2";"3"];;

```
------------------------------------------------------------
## Pattern matching
Very powerful, because we can ensure that all cases are handled!
