# Partial Function Application

When you write down a function definition with several arguments

A function
```ocaml
let f1 = fun x y -> exp
```

is the same as
```ocaml
let f2 = function x -> (function y -> exp);;
```

Since f2 can be applied to ONE argument, yield a function,
we can do the same with f1...

f1 can be applied to one argument only!

------------------------------------------------------------
## Example
```ocaml
let f1 = fun x y z -> x + y + z;;
val f1 : int -> int -> int -> int = <fun>
- FUNCTION DEFINITION

let f2 = f1 1;;
- FUNCTION APPLICATION OF f1
- function DEFINITION of f2
val f2 : int -> int -> int = <fun>

let f3 = f2 2;;
val f3 : int -> int = <fun>

f3 4;;
- : int = 7
```


------------------------------------------------------------
## What happens at function application
Application of function x -> e to a
- evaluate `e` in a context `x = a`

- we bind the formal parameter `x` with the actual value, which is `a`

No evaluation every happens below a function

The arrow -> blocks evaluation

No computation ever takes place in OCaml below functional abstraction

```ocaml
let f1 = fun x y -> (x / 0) + y;;

- now let's give the value for "x":
let f2 = f1 17;;

- no errors yet
- the calculation is protected by the functional abstraction behind
the function "y", expecting its argument


f2 42;;
- now we have error
- a RUNTIME error

```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Partial Evaluation
- Sometimes we can do part of a calculation as soon as we have the
first few arguments
- Factor out that part of the calculation in order to profit from
PARTIAL EVALUTION

for example, being able to compare one list with many other lists...

```ocaml
let egal l1 l2 =
  List.sort compare l1 = List.sort compare l2;;

let f = egal [783;42;17'];;

f [17;42;783];;

let egalp l1 =
  (* as soon as we are given this 1st argument, we sort it *)
  let l1sorted = List.sort compare l1
  (* here, we are returning a FUNCTION as the return value *)
  in function l2 -> l1sorted = List.sort compare l2;;

let f = egalp [783;42;17];;

f [17;42;783];;
