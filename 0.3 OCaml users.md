# Why OCaml: voices from the user base

Teaching
- many universities
- France, where the language was born
- US: CU, Harvard, MIT

Advanced Research Projects
- Coq proof assistant
- Astree static analyser (verifies Airbus A380 code)
- Frama-C platform (analysis of C code)
- Oscigen (Advanced web application framework)
- Alt-Ergo (advanced SMT solver)
  - SMT: Satisfiability modulo theories
- Mirage OS (unikernel)
- Flow / Hack (PHP / JS type checkers)
  - the type checker is fundamentally written in OCaml
    ...

Industry
- Bloomberg (finance)
- Facebook
- Microsoft
- Citrix

------------------------------------------------------------
Astree = the static analyser used by Airbus to prove the A380's command and
control bug free
- A type-safe functional language was the natural choice to implement the Astree
  analyzer. OCaml's robust design supported a scalable development process, from
  research to industry, and we appreciated its high performance native code
  compiler

The Coq proof assistant: a formal proof management system
> Amongst all the great features of OCaml, PATTERN MATCHING is crucial for Coq:
> without it, implementing complex symbolic computations would be a nightmare!

------------------------------------------------------------
> In OCaml, you just define the TYPE of your DATA, and the compiler will gently
> drive you towards your destination

LexiFi: Finance
> Safety, readability, expressivity, and great performance are often cited as
> key benefits of OCaml, but we also value the portability of the system

Summary
1. Safety:
  - strong static typing
  - pattern matching
2. Efficiency:
  - a high performance compiler
3. Expressiveness
  - a combinatoin of a functional language
  - with type inference
  - and polymorphism
