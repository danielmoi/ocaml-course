## Computing
- the study of algorithmic processes that describe and transform information
- the fundamental question: What can be (efficiently) automated?

Basic components of computing
- a program that describes the intended transformation of information
- a machine that executes the program

Hilbert's decision problem
- a mathematical logic questio
- can we devise a process to determine, in a finite number of operations,
  whether a first-order logic statement is valid?
- No

Alan Turing answers Hilbert's question in 1936
- inventing the Turing machine
- basically a finite state automata
- theoretical foundation of modern computers and imperative programming
- tape: addressable read-write memory with stored program
- automaton: microprocessor

In an imperative program, we read, write, and perform operations and take
decisions based on the contents of memory cells that hold the contents of
variables.

All about manipulation of memory cells.
Storing and manipulating values / variables.

Alonzo Church (Alan Turing's advisor)
- also answer's Hilbert's question in 1936 with a completely different approach,
inventing the Lambda calculus.
- λx.M = nameless function with formal parameter x and body M (abstraction)
- MN = call function M with actual parameter N (application)

Theoretical foundation of functional programming

(λx.M)N → ᵦM[x := N]

The β reduction rule is the one and only computational device in the system!

- if we have a function with formal parameter x, and body M, to which we
pass an actual parameter (the VALUE, N), then what I do is just evaluate the
body of the function M, by replacing the actual parameter N in place of the
formal parameter x
- that is the ONLY computational device

------------------------------------------------------------
The λ calculus and FP
- in a FP, we define functions, and compose and apply them to COMPUTE
the expected results

```ocaml
let rec factorial = function n -> if n = 0 then 1 else n * (factorial (n - 1))
```

In a truly FP language, functions are first class citizens.
They can be
- named
- evaluated
- passed as arguments
- returned as results
- used everywhere an EXPRESSION can fit

------------------------------------------------------------
The Church-Turing thesis
- equivalence of Turing machines and λ calculus (Turing, 1937)
- a function is computable by a Turing machine, if and only if, it is computable
  using λ-calculus
- In simpler terms, all general purpose programming languages are
  COMPUTATIONALLY EQUIVALENT

But programming languages are not born equal
- they are different EXPRESSIVENESS
- the quest for more expressive constructs is never endinf
- different
  - data representations
  - execution models
  - mechanisms of abstractions

And there are many other desirable features
- safety of execution
- efficiency
- maintainability

Depending on the problem at hand, some programming languages
may be way better than others

------------------------------------------------------------
An early assessment from FORTRAN's very creator
- functional programs deal with structured data
- do not name their arguments, and do not require the complex
  machinery of procedure declarations

  "Can programming be liberated from the von Neumann style?"
  - John Backus, Turing lecture, 1978

------------------------------------------------------------
Report on Computer Science Education at Carnegie Mellon
- there are some clear emerging trends
- need for greater software reliability (less bugs)
- pure FP programs are easier to prove correct than imperative ones

- harness the power of parallel computation
- a carefully chosen set of HOF allows to write programs that are
  easily parallelisable
- very well known example: MapReduce combinator provider by Google

The power and expressivity of FP is being recognised widely:
- Java 1.8 introduces lambda expression
- C++ 11 introduces lambda expressions
