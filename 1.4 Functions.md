# Functions

In FP, functions are the basic means to structure and to generalize code.

This sequence shows some simple examples of function definitions in OCaml.

We discuss the principle of LEXICAL SCOPING

We demonstrate that identifiers are not variables in the sense of imperative programming.

------------------------------------------------------------
In OCaml, functions are in reality VALUES, just like any other value in OCaml.

Here is a global definition of a function that has one argument:
```ocaml
let f x = exp
```

Where "exp" is an expression, ie. the body of the function, which would use the argument "x"

Local definition of a function that has one argument:
```ocaml
let f x = exp1 in
exp2 (* we can use f here, insdie exp2)
```


------------------------------------------------------------
Scoping Rules: as before.
Local definitions HIDE more global ones


------------------------------------------------------------
## Function application
Application of function named "f" to expression "e":
```ocaml
f e
```

Parentheses are only needed if required to indicate STRUCTURE of expressions

------------------------------------------------------------
```ocaml
(* global function definition *)
let f x = x+1;;

f 17;; (* function application *)

let g y = 2*y (* local function definition *)
in g 42;; (* function application, locally, with 42 as the value of 7.
ie. 42*2, but this value won't be available after this expression is evaluated *)

f f 1;;
(* Type error - this function has type int -> int but we have given it 2 arguments (f and 1) *)

f f;;
Error: This expression has type int -> int
       but an expression was expected of type int

       ( We passed in a FUNCTION, instead of an int)

f (f 1);;
- f (2)
- 3
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Lexical Scoping
OCaml, like all modern programming languages, is governed by the principle of
LEXICAL SCOPING

Lexical scoping: identifier used in the definition of a function refers to the
identifier visible at the moment of function DEFINITION / DECLARATION

Dynamic Scoping: ... visible at the moment of function INVOCATION / EXECUTION

------------------------------------------------------------
```ocaml
(* with local definitions *)
let f x = x+1 in
let g y = f (f y) in (* here, "f" refers to the function on the line above *)
  (* "g" is DEFINED here, so this is the moment of function DEFINITION *)
let f x = 2*x in (* and NOT the "f" here, even though our invocation is on the line after this *)
g 5;; (* function application, (5+1) + 1, ie. 7 *)
- 7
- if we had DYNAMIC SCOPING, f would be 2*x, so we would get 2 * (2*5) ie. 20

(* with global definitions *)
let f x = x+1;;
let g y = f (f y);;  (* this is the moment of function DEFINITION, f is captured here *)
let f x = 2*x;;
g 5;; (* function application *)

SAME ANSWER.

```js
> f = (x) => x +1;
[Function: f]
> g = (y) => f(f(y))
[Function: g]
> f = (x) => 2*x;
[Function: f]
> g(5);
20
```

So.... does this mean that JavaScript has DYNAMIC SCOPING?
- well kind of
- without using let / const / var, we default to `var`
- which is in the global scope
- and we are re-assigning the value "f"
- so, this is dynamic scoping

if we use "const", then we would not be able to re-assign...

But we still get this:
```js
> a = 100
100
> const x = () => a;
undefined
> x()
100
> a = 200;
200
> x()
200
```

Which means that there is still dynamic scoping.
The value of a has changed, and the 2nd invocation of x takes this new value.


------------------------------------------------------------
## Identifiers are NOT variables
- An identifier may be hidden by a new definition for the same name
- Don't confuse with "changing the value of a variable"
- Static binding can give you indirect access to an otherwise hidden identifier

```ocaml
let a = 1;;
- this is a let binding for a

let f x = x + a;;
- this is where "f" is defined
- we have captured the value of "a" here.

f 2;;
- 2 + 1
- 3

let a = 73;;
- this is a new binding for "a"
- but we have not assigned "a" above this value
- we have simply created a new identifier
- this new binding HIDES the first a, the first a is no longer visible.
- any subsequent calls to "a" from now onwards in time will refer to this "a"

f 2;;
- "a" is still 1
- 3
```

If you do a LET BINDING twice, on an identifier with the same name,
this is NOT an assignment operation.
it is a definition of a new identifier.
