# Arrays

In many situations, the numner of components of a compsite value cannot be
determined at compile-time.

Arrays are data structures which size is DYNAMICALLY computed.

------------------------------------------------------------
A limitation of tuples and records: their SIZE is statically bounded.

Sometimes, we can't predict how much data we are going to process.

In exchange for this flexibility, for type-checking to remain simple, all array
elements must have the SAME TYPE.

------------------------------------------------------------
An array of static size, with 3 elements
```ocaml
let p = [| 1; 2; 3|];
- val p : int array = [|1; 2; 3; |];

```
------------------------------------------------------------
```ocaml
let square x = x * x;;

let squares n = Array.init n square;;
- we initialize an array of size n
- val squares : int -> int array = <fun>

let s1 = squares 5;;
- val s1 : int array = [|0; 1; 4; 9; 16|]

```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Syntax for array type
- The typeof an array whose elements have some_type is:
```ocaml
some_type array
```

- "array" is a predefined TYPE CONSTRUCTOR
- the standard library module Array provides functions over arrays

------------------------------------------------------------
## Syntax for array construction
- Arrays whose elements and sizes are KNOWN at COMPILE-time are written:
```
[| some_expression; ...; some_expression |]
```

- the FUNCTION Array.make expects an INTEGER, representing the SIZE of the array
  and a VALUE to initialize each component of the array

- there is another function to initialize arrays: Array.init, which expects
  an INTEGER, representing the SIZE of the array, and a FUNCTION to initialize
  each component of the array

- this initialization function is given the INDEX of the component
  and must return its VALUE

- Array.length is a function that returns the SIZE of an array

------------------------------------------------------------
## Syntax to observe array cells
- To observe a specific component of an array using an INDEX:
- an INTEGER that corresponds to a POSITION of this component in the array
```
some_expression.(some_expression)
<array>.(an-integer)
```

- be careful, because arrays are zero-indexed, and the index is between
  0 and Array.length a - 1

- to observe SEVERAL components of an array, on can use ARRAY PATTERNS:
```
[| some_pattern; ...; some_pattern |]
```
- we are replacing expressions with patterns

- array patterns are NOT very CONVENIENT when we program

------------------------------------------------------------
```ocaml
let swap a = [| a.(1) a.(0) |];;
- val swap : 'a array -> 'a array = <fun>
- the array is polymorphic

let b = swap [| 0; 1 |];;
- [| 1; 0 |]
```

------------------------------------------------------------
```ocaml
let swap [| x; y; |] = [| y; x; }|];;
- an array of size 2, the name of the first CELL is x,
- the name of the second cell is y
- returns an array with 2 cells
- Warning: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive
- here is an example of a value that is not matched: [| |]
- ie. an empty array

let t = swap [| 2; 1 |];;

let t = swap [| 2; 1; 0 |];;
- this causes our program to CRASH
- Exception: Match_failure
- so arrays are not very good when we use them as arguments for a function
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## In the machine

- In memory, an array is a HEAP-ALLOCATED BLOCK
- same as tuples and records

```ocaml
let p = [| 1; 2; 3 |];;

let q = [| p; p |];;
- p is a REFERENCE

```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Pitfals: Hetergeneous element types
- All the elements in an array must have the same TYPE
- these will be caught by the type checker
```ocaml
let a = [| true; 1 |];;
- Error: this expression has type int, but is expecting boolean

```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Pitfalls: Out of bound
- Very common, and unfortunately NOT caught by the compiler
- the compiler cannot ensure that all observations are valid
- this is "invalid access" / invalid index
  - negative index
  - index > length - 1

```ocaml
let a = [| 0; 1; 2; |];;

let x = a.(3);;
- Error: Invalid_argument 'index out of bounds'

let y = a.(-1);;
- Error: Invalid_argument 'index out of bounds'
```
