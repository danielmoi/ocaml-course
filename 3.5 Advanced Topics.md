# Advanced Topics About Data Types

## Precise typing
A sum type with only one constructor can be useful to discriminate
between 2 types that are structurally equivalent
but semantically different.

```ocaml
type euro = Euro of float;;

type dollar = Dollar of float;;

let euro_of_dollar (Dollar d) = Euro (d /. 1.33);;

let x = Dollar 4.;;

(* we are using a TYPE CONSTRUCTOR HERE *)
let y = Dollar 5.;;

let invalid_comparison = (x < y);;
- compiler error
- this expression (y) has type euro but an expression was expect of type dollar

let valid_comparison = (euro_of_dollar x < y);;
- now we are comparing Euros with Euros

```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Disjunctive patterns
Sometimes, the same code is duplicated in several branches

or-patterns allow you to FACTORIZE these branches into a unique branch

`some_pattern_1 | some_pattern_2` corresponds to the observation of
`some_pattern_1 or some_pattern_2`

`some_pattern_1` and `some_pattern_2` must contain the same IDENTIFIERS

```ocaml
let remove_zero_or_one_head = function
| 0 :: xs -> xs
| 1 :: xs -> xs
| l -> l;;

- factorize out " -> xs"
let remove_zero_or_one_head' = function
| 0 :: xs | 1 :: xs -> xs
| l -> l;;

- factorize out ":: xs" inside our pattern!
let remove_zero_or_one_head'' = functino
| (0 | 1 ) :: xs -> xs
| l -> l;;

```

------------------------------------------------------------
## as-patterns
It is sometimes convenient to NAME a matched component

The pattern `some_pattern as x` is read as
"if the value can be observed using `some_pattern`, name it `x`"

```ocaml
let rec duplicate_head_at_the_end = function
| [] -> []
| (x::_) as l -> l @ [x];;

let l = duplicate_head_at_the_end [1;2;3;];;

```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Constrained pattern matching branch using "when"
A boolean expression, called a "guard" can add an EXTRA
constraint to a PATTERN

This guard is introduced by the keyword "when".

```ocaml
let rec push_max_at_the_end = function
(* - ie. empty or ONE element in list *)
| ([] | [_]) as l -> l

(* these next 2 patterns are the same, but the 1st will have an extra check *)
| x :: ((y :: _) as l) when x <= y ->
  x :: push_max_at_the_end l

| x :: y :: ys ->
  y :: push_max_at_the_end (x :: ys)
;;

let l = push_max_at_the_end [3;2;1];;
- [2;1;3]

```
------------------------------------------------------------
## Other kinds of types
There are advanced features of the type system that we did not show:
- Objects
- First class modules
- Polymorphic variants
- Generalized algebraic datatypes

## Quiz:
Let's rewrite some pattern matching with advanced constructs.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Quiz: Disjunctive patterns ("or")
Factorize the pattern matching of function simplify using or-patterns. It should
boil down to three cases.

```ocaml
type e = EInt of int | EMul of e * e | EAdd of e * e

let simplify = function
  | EMul (EInt 1, e) -> e
  | EMul (e, EInt 1) -> e
  | EMul (EInt 0, e) -> EInt 0
  | EMul (e, EInt 0) -> EInt 0
  | EAdd (EInt 0, e) -> e
  | EAdd (e, EInt 0) -> e
  | e -> e;;

let simplify = function
| EMul (EInt 1, e) | EMul (e, EInt 1) -> e
| EMul (EInt 0, e) | EMul (e, EInt 0) -> EInt 0
| EAdd (EInt 0, e) | EAdd (e, EInt 0) | e -> e
;;

```
------------------------------------------------------------
## Quiz
The `only_small_lists` function takes a list as input and returns this list only
if it contains two or less elements, otherwise the empty list is returned.
Rewrite this function using or-patterns and an as-pattern. It should boil down
to two cases.

```ocaml
let only_small_lists = function
  | [] -> []
  | [x] -> [x]
  | [x;y] -> [x;y]
  | _ -> [];;

- we are calling [x] and [x;y] as "l"
- but we cannot use "l" because it has to be on the other side
let only_small_lists = function
| ([x] | [x;_]) as l -> l
| [] | _ -> [];;
