# Case Study: Story Teller

Types play a central part in OCaml programming

Writing the right type declarations help the programmer
implement the right program

We will illustrate this TYPE-DIRECTED programming.

(story.ml)

## Assisted incremental programming
Our stories are a bit boring

If we change type declarations, the type-checker will assist
us by pinpointing what part of the code must be UPDATED.

Introducing the "zombie" action...

## Higher-order programming
The first version of our story teller is 178 lines long

A skilled OCaml programmer would write the same code in 133 lines (-25%)

```ocaml
let rec all_characters_are states function
| [] -> true
| character :: cs -> is_one_of states character.state &&
  all_characters_are states cs
;;
```

can be rewritten as a HIGHER ORDER FUNCTION:
```ocaml
let all_characters_are states =
  List.for_all { is_one_of states }
;;
```
