# The OCaml language: history and key features

OCaml belongs to the family of staticaly strongly styped FP programming
languages started by Sir Robin Milner's ML.

ML = Meta Language

A theory of type polymorphism in programming 1978

Core features
1. Hindley-Milner polymorphic types, Damas-Milner type inference
- type inference: you don't need to write them
2. Algebraic data types, Pattern matching
- pattern matching: life saving data manipulation feature
3. First-class functions


------------------------------------------------------------
1980 the Projet Formel at INRIA
- under the direction of Gerard Huet
- seminal work on mechanising mathematics
- uses Milner's ML language
- contributes to it (notably, pattern matching)
- and then starts developing its own

Raising the first Caml
- 1985 Guy Cousineau, Pierre-Louis Curien and Michel Mauny design the
  Categorical Abstract Machine
- 1987 Ascander Suarez releases the first Caml implementation
- 1988-1992 Michel Mauny and Pierre Weis nuture the Caml and make it grow

The system was impressive, but quite complex and needed professional
workstations to run

Caml = CAM + ML

------------------------------------------------------------
Then early nineties: the age of Caml light

1990-1991 Xavier Leroy creates the Zinc Abstract Machine,
Damien Doligez writes a great memory manager, and the result is Caml Light
- small footprint (fits in a floppy)
- portable: based on a bytecode interpreter
- efficient: runs on a PC

The Zinc machine is very different from the CAM, but the name stayed

-------------------------------------------------------------
1995 - Caml Special Light: compiler to native code, rich module system

1996 - Objective Caml: efficient, elegant object oriented layer (Jerome Vouillon
and Didier Remy)
  - object orientation and polymorphic type inference

2000: merge of Jacques Garrigue's extended Objective Label branch with polymorphic
methods, labelled and optional arguments, and polymoprhic variants

2011: The name is definitely changed to OCaml
