# More Advanced Data Structures

- We have defined FLAT data structures, which are nice to aggregate values
- but are quite limited when you try to STRUCTURE VALUES

- Algebraic datatypes offer several mechanisms to attach more informative static
  description of values using TAGS
  - to define data structures like LISTS
  - to structure values in a HIERARCHICAL way

- Type definition in OCaml can be made more generic with parameterized type defitions
