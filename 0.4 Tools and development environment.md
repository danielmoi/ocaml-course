# Tools and development environment

OCaml today is a rich set of development tools

- a modern package manager for installing the libraries you need and speed up development (OPAM)
- hundreds of packaged libraries
- debugger
- profiler

A rich set of compiler tools
- REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) for fast development ("toplevel")
- ocamlc bytecode compiler for portable code
- ocamlopt native compiler for fast executables
  - executables that run much faster than the bytecode compiler
  - but we lose portability (need one per system)
- js_of_ocaml compiler to JS for building web apps

------------------------------------------------------------
REPL
- reads your program, phrase by phrase
- compiled on the fly (compiled, not interpreted), reporting any error found
- evalutes it
- prints the results

So we can see the results produced by the program, without writing a printer.

```

# List.map (fun x -> x + 1)[1;2;3;4;5;6];;
-: int list = [2;3;4;5;6;7]
