# Polymorphic Algebraic Datatypes

The type for "List" is parameterized by the type of the elements in the list.

This polymorphic algebraic datatype is very convenient, because it improves
code REUSE: the module List is written ONCE, and provides functions over
lists of ANY ELEMENT TYPE.

We will now learn the syntax to define our own parameterized types.


----
`list` is a TYPE CONSTRUCTOR, parameterized by the type of the elements.
Most of the functions over lists do not depend on the type of the elements.

Hence, the module `List` only contains POLYMORPHIC FUNCTIONS.


----
## Example
```ocaml

(* There is only one parameter, and the value is optional *)
type 'a option =
  | None
  | Some of 'a;;

(* When you don't want to give alpha a value, you use the None constructor
and when you want alpha to have a value, you use the Some constructor *)

let o1 = Some 42;;

let o2 = None;;
```

----
## Example
```ocaml

These are 2 data constructors (Left, and Right)
type ('a, 'b) either =
| Left of 'a
| Right of 'b
;;


type square = { dimension: int };;

type circle = { radius: int };;

type shape = (square, circle) either;;

let a_shape = Left { dimension = 42 };;
val a_shape : (square, 'a) either = Left {dimension = 42}

let another_shape = Right { radius = 10 };;
val another_shape : ('a, circle) either = Right {radius = 10}

type ('a, 'b) my_either =
  | ThisOne of 'a
  | ThatOne of 'b;;
type shape = (square, circle) my_either;;
let shape_a = ThisOne { dimension = 10 };;
val shape_a : (square, 'a) my_either = ThisOne {dimension = 10}

let shape_b = ThatOne { radius = 1 };;
val shape_b : ('a, circle) my_either = ThatOne {radius = 1}

```

## Type for binary search trees

```ocaml
type 'a bst =
| Empty
| Node of 'a bst * 'a * 'a bst;;

let rec insert x = function
| Empty -> Node (Empty, x, Empty)
| Node (left, y, right) ->
  if x = y then Node (left, y, right)
  else if x < y) then Node (insert x left, y, right)
  else Node (left, y, insert x right)
;;

let rec find_max = function
| Empty -> assert false
| Node (_, x, Empty) -> x
| Node (_, x, right) -> find_max right;;

let rec delete = function
| Empty -> Empty
| Node (left, y, right) ->
  if x = y then join left right
  else if x < y then Node (delete x left, y, right)
  else Node (left, y, delete x right)
and join left right =
  match left, right with
  | Empty, right -> right
  | left, Empty -> left
  | left, right ->
    let m = find_max l in
    Node (delete m left, m, right);;

type contact = {
  name: string;
  phone_number: int
};;

type database = contact bst;;

```

There is less NOISE, allowing us to focus on the DATA STRUCTURE;;

## Syntax for parameterized types
To DECLARE a parameterized type:

```ocaml
type ('a1, ..., 'aN) some_type_identifier = some_type
```

The TYPE VARIABLES `'a1` ... `'aN` all represent UNKNOWN TYPES

They can appear in `some_type`

To INSTANTIATE a parameterized type, we write
```ocaml
let x = { some_type, ..., some_type } some_type_identifier;;
```


----
## Pitfalls
The arity of the type constructor must be respected.

The type variables must be declared.

```ocaml
- there are TWO type parameters here, alpha and beta
type ('a, 'b) t = 'a * 'b * 'a;;

- we instantiate "t" here...
- Error, the type constructor "t" is expecting TWO arguments
type u = (int, bool, string) t;;

type u = (int, bool) t;;
