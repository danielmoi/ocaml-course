# Tree-like values

We will go further with recursive datatypes.

Tree-like datastructures are also omnipresent in CS because they allow
for a hierarchical organization of data.

Defining a type for a tree is straightforward in OCaml using a
recursive algebraic datatype.

We will refactor our typed database by replacing arrays with such
a tree-like representation.

------------------------------------------------------------
## A tree-like representation for databases

Consider the following tree-like representation for databases:
```ocaml
type database =
| NoContact
| DataNode of database * contact * database
```

Here there is a left-child database, and a right-child database

We will enforce a VARIANT.

A database node DataNode (left, c, right) is well-formed if
- every contact in left is lexicographically smaller than c
- every contact in right is lexicographically greater than c

- lexicographically = dictionary

------------------------------------------------------------
## In the machine
Root DataNode db    luke      db
              |                |
              |                DataNode
              DataNode

------------------------------------------------------------
## Looking for a contact
```ocaml
let search db name =
  let rec traverse = function
  | NoContact -> Error
  | DataNode (left, contact, right) ->
    if contact.name = name then
      FoundContact contact
    else if name < contact.name then
      traverse left
    else traverse right
  in traverse db
;;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## A more efficient lookup
- in the worst case, the contact is not found, and we have crossed a number of
  nodes which is bounded by the height of tree
- in the array-based implementation, the entire database is traversed
- it is unlikely that the height of the tree is equal to the number of contacts!
  (this would mean that the tree is degenerated into a list)
- as an exercise, try to maintain the extra invariant that the tree is BALANCED,
  ie. that its height is bounded by the logarithm of the number of contacts

------------------------------------------------------------
## Inserting a contact
```ocaml
let insert db contact =
  let rec traverse tree =
    match tree with
    | NoContact ->
      (* return a new, empty, database *)
        DataNode (NoContact, contact, NoContact)
    | DataNode (left, contact', right) ->
      if contact.name = contact'.name then tree
      else if contact.anme < contact'.name then
        (* we keep / re-use the same "right" *)
        DataNode (traverse left, contact', right)
      else
        (* we keep / re-use the same "left" *)
        DataNode (left, contact', traverse right)
  in
  NewDatabase (traverse db)
  ;;

ie. insertion shares subtrees between databases

ie. insertion is sharing original subtrees from the input database

```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Removing an element
Removing the root, would leave us with 2 subtrees.

```
            1
          /   \
        2       5
       / \     / \
      3   4   6   7

        2       5
       / \     / \
      3   4   6   7
```

Removing an element seems a bit complicated.
We should be able to focus on the tree problem, independently
  of the fact that it represents a database.

This is the separation of concerns princple.

Forthcoming PARAMETERIZED TYPES will help us perform such a
MODULAR DEVELOPMENT.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Symbolic manipulation of arithmetic expressions

Abstract syntax trees are a convenient way of representing
a syntactic expression in a structured way.

Let us consider arithmetic expressions formed by the following rules:
- an integer is an arithmetic expression
- if lhs and rhs are arithmetic expressions then lhs + rhs is an
  arithmetic expression
- if lhs and rhs are arithmetic expressions then lhs * rhs is an
  arithmetic expression

Such an expression can be represented by a value of type "exp"
as defined in the given prelude (as well as the definition of
"1 + 2 + 3" as an example)


```ocaml
type exp =
  | EInt of int (* this is the integer type "int" *)
  | EAdd of exp * exp (* ie. this is a PAIR *)
  | EMul of exp * exp;;

let example =
  EAdd (EInt 1, EMul (EInt 2, EInt 3))
```

Write the expression "2 * 2 + 3 * 3" in a variable "my_example"
```ocaml

let my_example =
  EAdd(EMul (EInt 2, EInt 2), EMul(EInt 3, EInt 3));;

```

------------------------------------------------------------
Write a function eval : exp -> int that computes the value of an arithmetic expression. The evaluation rules are:

If the expression is an integer x, the evaluation is x.
If the expression is lhs + rhs and lhs evaluates to x and rhs evaluates to y, then the evaluation is x + y.
If the expression is lhs * rhs and lhs evaluates to x and rhs evaluates to y, then the evaluation is x * y.

```ocaml
let eval exp =
  match exp with
  | EInt x -> x
  | EAdd x * x -> x + x
;;
Error: Syntax Error

let eval exp =
  match exp with
  | EInt x -> x
  | EAdd (x, x) -> x + x
;;
Error: Variable x is bound several times in this matching


let eval exp =
  match exp with
  | EInt x -> x
  | EAdd(lhs, rhs) -> lhs + rhs
;;
Error: This expression has type exp but an expression was expected of type
         int


let rec eval exp =
  match exp with
  | EInt x -> x
  | EAdd(EInt lhs, EInt rhs) -> lhs + rhs
  | EAdd(EInt lhs, EAdd (EInt a, EInt b)) ->
      lhs + eval (EAdd (EInt (a), EInt (b)))
;;
- not exhaustive

let rec eval exp =
  match exp with
  | EInt x -> x
  | EAdd(x, y) -> eval x + eval y
  | EMul(x, y) -> eval x * eval y
;;

eval (EInt (-3));;
(*
NOTE: The brackets are required,
else we get this
Error: This function has type exp -> int
       It is applied to too many arguments; maybe you forgot a `;'.
*)
eval (EAdd (EInt (-9), EInt (-9)));;

```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Factorize
If an expression is of the form a * b + a * c then a * (b + c) is a factorized equivalent expression.
Write a function factorize : exp -> exp that implements this transformation on its input exp if it has the shape a * b + a * c or does nothing otherwise.

```ocaml
let factorize exp =
match exp with
| EAdd(EMul(a,b), EMul(c,d)) ->
    if (a = c) then EMul(a, EAdd(b, d))
    else exp
| _ -> exp
;;

factorize
  (EAdd (EMul (EInt 1, EInt 1),
    EMul (EInt 1,
     EMul (EMul (EInt 5, EAdd (EInt 0, EInt (-1))), EMul (EInt 9, EInt 3)))));;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Expand
Write the reverse transformation of factorize, expand : exp -> exp, which turns an expression of the shape a * (b + c) into a * b + a * c.

```ocaml
let expand exp =
match exp with
| EMul(a, EAdd(b,c)) -> EAdd(EMul(a,b), EMul(a,c))
| _ -> exp
;;

expand
  (EMul
    (EMul (EAdd (EAdd (EInt (-4), EInt (-1)), EMul (EInt (-2), EInt 4)),
      EInt 4),
    EAdd (EMul (EInt 1, EInt 6), EInt (-5))));;
```
