# Tree-like values

We will go further with recursive datatypes.

Tree-like datastructures are also omnipresent in CS because they allow
for a hierarchical organization of data.

Defining a type for a tree is straightforward in OCaml using a
recursive algebraic datatype.

We will refactor our typed database by replacing arrays with such
a tree-like representation.

------------------------------------------------------------
## A tree-like representation for databases

Consider the following tree-like representation for databases:
```ocaml
type database =
| NoContact
| DataNode of database * contact * database
```

Here there is a left-child database, and a right-child database

We will enforce a VARIANT.

A database node DataNode (left, c, right) is well-formed if
- every contact in left is lexicographically smaller than c
- every contact in right is lexicographically greater than c

- lexicographically = dictionary

------------------------------------------------------------
## In the machine
Root DataNode db    luke      db
              |                |
              |                DataNode
              DataNode

------------------------------------------------------------
## Looking for a contact
```ocaml
let search db name =
  let rec traverse = function
  | NoContact -> Error
  | DataNode (left, contact, right) ->
    if contact.name = name then
      FoundContact contact
    else if name < contact.name then
      traverse left
    else traverse right
  in traverse db
;;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## A more efficient lookup
- in the worst case, the contact is not found, and we have crossed a number of
  nodes which is bounded by the height of tree
- in the array-based implementation, the entire database is traversed
- it is unlikely that the height of the tree is equal to the number of contacts!
  (this would mean that the tree is degenerated into a list)
- as an exercise, try to maintain the extra invariant that the tree is BALANCED,
  ie. that its height is bounded by the logarithm of the number of contacts

------------------------------------------------------------
## Inserting a contact
```ocaml
let insert db contact =
  let rec traverse tree =
    match tree with
    | NoContact ->
      (* return a new, empty, database *)
        DataNode (NoContact, contact, NoContact)
    | DataNode (left, contact', right) ->
      if contact.name = contact'.name then tree
      else if contact.anme < contact'.name then
        (* we keep / re-use the same "right" *)
        DataNode (traverse left, contact', right)
      else
        (* we keep / re-use the same "left" *)
        DataNode (left, contact', traverse right)
  in
  NewDatabase (traverse db)
  ;;

ie. insertion shares subtrees between databases

ie. insertion is sharing original subtrees from the input database

```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Removing an element
Removing the root, would leave us with 2 subtrees.

```
            1
          /   \
        2       5
       / \     / \
      3   4   6   7

        2       5
       / \     / \
      3   4   6   7
```

Removing an element seems a bit complicated.
We should be able to focus on the tree problem, independently
  of the fact that it represents a database.

This is the separation of concerns princple.

Forthcoming PARAMETERIZED TYPES will help us perform such a
MODULAR DEVELOPMENT.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Symbolic manipulation of arithmetic expressions

Abstract syntax trees are a convenient way of representing
a syntactic expression in a structured way.

Let us consider arithmetic expressions formed by the following rules:
- an integer is an arithmetic expression
- if lhs and rhs are arithmetic expressions then lhs + rhs is an
  arithmetic expression
- if lhs and rhs are arithmetic expressions then lhs * rhs is an
  arithmetic expression

Such an expression can be represented by a value of type "exp"
as defined in the given prelude (as well as the definition of
"1 + 2 + 3" as an example)


```ocaml
type exp =
  | EInt of int (* this is the integer type "int" *)
  | EAdd of exp * exp (* ie. this is a PAIR *)
  | EMul of exp * exp;;

let example =
  EAdd (EInt 1, EMul (EInt 2, EInt 3))
```

Write the expression "2 * 2 + 3 * 3" in a variable "my_example"
```ocaml

let my_example =
  EAdd(EMul (EInt 2, EInt 2), EMul(EInt 3, EInt 3));;

```

------------------------------------------------------------
Write a function eval : exp -> int that computes the value of an arithmetic expression. The evaluation rules are:

If the expression is an integer x, the evaluation is x.
If the expression is lhs + rhs and lhs evaluates to x and rhs evaluates to y, then the evaluation is x + y.
If the expression is lhs * rhs and lhs evaluates to x and rhs evaluates to y, then the evaluation is x * y.

```ocaml
let eval exp =
  match exp with
  | EInt x -> x
  | EAdd x * x -> x + x
;;
Error: Syntax Error

let eval exp =
  match exp with
  | EInt x -> x
  | EAdd (x, x) -> x + x
;;
Error: Variable x is bound several times in this matching


let eval exp =
  match exp with
  | EInt x -> x
  | EAdd(lhs, rhs) -> lhs + rhs
;;
Error: This expression has type exp but an expression was expected of type
         int


let rec eval exp =
  match exp with
  | EInt x -> x
  | EAdd(EInt lhs, EInt rhs) -> lhs + rhs
  | EAdd(EInt lhs, EAdd (EInt a, EInt b)) ->
      lhs + eval (EAdd (EInt (a), EInt (b)))
;;
- not exhaustive

let rec eval exp =
  match exp with
  | EInt x -> x
  | EAdd(x, y) -> eval x + eval y
  | EMul(x, y) -> eval x * eval y
;;

eval (EInt (-3));;
(*
NOTE: The brackets are required,
else we get this
Error: This function has type exp -> int
       It is applied to too many arguments; maybe you forgot a `;'.
*)
eval (EAdd (EInt (-9), EInt (-9)));;

```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Factorize
If an expression is of the form a * b + a * c then a * (b + c) is a factorized equivalent expression.
Write a function factorize : exp -> exp that implements this transformation on its input exp if it has the shape a * b + a * c or does nothing otherwise.

```ocaml
let factorize exp =
match exp with
| EAdd(EMul(a,b), EMul(c,d)) ->
    if (a = c) then EMul(a, EAdd(b, d))
    else exp
| _ -> exp
;;

factorize
  (EAdd (EMul (EInt 1, EInt 1),
    EMul (EInt 1,
     EMul (EMul (EInt 5, EAdd (EInt 0, EInt (-1))), EMul (EInt 9, EInt 3)))));;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Expand
Write the reverse transformation of factorize, expand : exp -> exp, which turns an expression of the shape a * (b + c) into a * b + a * c.

```ocaml
let expand exp =
match exp with
| EMul(a, EAdd(b,c)) -> EAdd(EMul(a,b), EMul(a,c))
| _ -> exp
;;

expand
  (EMul
    (EMul (EAdd (EAdd (EInt (-4), EInt (-1)), EMul (EInt (-2), EInt 4)),
      EInt 4),
    EAdd (EMul (EInt 1, EInt 6), EInt (-5))));;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Simplify
Implement a function simplify: exp -> exp which takes an expression e and:

If e is of the shape e * 0 or 0 * e, returns the expression 0.
If e is of the shape e * 1 or 1 * e, returns the expression e.
If e is of the shape e + 0 or 0 + e, returns the expression e.

and does nothing otherwise.

```ocaml
let simplify exp =
match exp with
| EMul(_, 0) -> 0
| _ -> exp
;;
Error: This pattern matches values of type int
       but a pattern was expected which matches values of type exp


let simplify exp =
match exp with
| EMul(_, EInt 0) -> EInt 0
| EMul(EInt 0, _) -> EInt 0
| EMul(_, EInt 1) -> exp
| EMul(EInt 1, _) -> exp
| EAdd(_, EInt 0) -> exp
| EAdd(EInt 0, _) -> exp
| _ -> exp
;;


Simpler:
let simplify exp =
match exp with
| EMul(_, EInt 0) | EMul(EInt 0, _) -> EInt 0
| EMul(_, EInt 1) | EMul(EInt 1, _) -> exp
| EAdd(_, EInt 0) | EAdd(EInt 0, _) -> exp
| _ -> exp
;;

NUP:
let simplify exp =
match exp with
| EMul(_, EInt 0 | EInt 0, _) -> EInt 0
| EMul(_, EInt 1) | EMul(EInt 1, _) -> exp
| EAdd(_, EInt 0) | EAdd(EInt 0, _) -> exp
| _ -> exp
;;

Correct:
let simplify exp =
match exp with
| EMul(_, EInt 0) -> EInt 0
| EMul(EInt 0, _) -> EInt 0
| EMul(a, EInt 1) -> a
| EMul(EInt 1, a) -> a
| EAdd(a, EInt 0) -> a
| EAdd(EInt 0, a) -> a
| _ -> exp
;;



simplify
  (EMul
    (EMul (EAdd (EInt (-9), EMul (EInt 6, EInt (-8))),
      EAdd (EMul (EInt (-10), EAdd (EInt (-5), EInt 8)),
       EAdd (EAdd (EInt (-2), EInt 5), EInt (-10)))),
    EInt 0));;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Tries

The data structure called TRIE is very convenient to represent
a dictionary whose keys are STRINGS.

It is a very space-efficient way while providing a very fast
lookup function.

We will implement such a data structure, assuming that we want
to associate INTEGERS to the STRINGS of the dictionary.

Let us define a trie using 2 mutually defined types:

- trie which represents a trie, that is a tree whose root may contain an integer and whose children are indexed by characters ;
- char_to_children which implements the associative data structure whose keys are characters and whose values are trie (childrens).

As a trade-off between speed and memory consumption, we choose an associative list to represent the association between characters and children.

The prelude also gives examples of empty trie and of another one that contains the following pairs (key, value):

[("A", 15); ("to", 7); ("tea", 3);("ted", 4); ("ten", 12); ("i", 11); ("in", 5); ("inn", 9)].

------------------------------------------------------------
Write a function
`children_from_char : char_to_children -> char -> trie option` such that

`children_from_char m c = Some t` if (c, t) is the first pair in m with c as a first component ;
`children_from_char m c = None` if no such pair exists in m.

```ocaml
type trie = Trie of int option * char_to_children
(* ie. a pair, int * list of pairs = int-(char-trie) PAIR *)

and char_to_children = (char * trie) list
(* ie. a list of pairs (char * trie) (char-trie) LIST *)


let empty =
  Trie (None, []);;

let example =
  Trie (None,
	[('i', Trie (Some 11,
                     [('n', Trie (Some 5, [('n', Trie (Some 9, []))]))]));
	 ('t',
	  Trie (None,
		[('e',
		  Trie (None,
			[('n', Trie (Some 12, [])); ('d', Trie (Some 4, []));
			 ('a', Trie (Some 3, []))]));
		 ('o', Trie (Some 7, []))]));
	 ('A', Trie (Some 15, []))]);;
```
```ocaml
char_to_children -> char -> trie option


let rec children_from_char m char =
  match m, char with
  | [(a, Trie (x,y))], b when a = char -> Some (Trie (x,y))
  | (a, Trie(x,y))::rest, _ when a = char -> Some (Trie (x,y))
  | (a, Trie(x,y))::rest, _ -> children_from_char rest char
  | _ -> None
  ;;

children_from_char
  [
   ('a', Trie (None, [('d', Trie (Some (-2), []))]));
   ('s', Trie (None, [('d', Trie (Some (-2), []))]));
   ('g', Trie (None, [('d', Trie (Some 2, []))]));
   ('j', Trie (None, [('s', Trie (None, [('p', Trie (Some (-1), []))]))]));
   ('p', Trie (None, [('p', Trie (Some (-4), []))]));
   ('m', Trie (None, [('j', Trie (None, [('d', Trie (Some (-1), []))]))]))
   ]
  'g';;
  ```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Quiz: Trie #2
Write a function update_children : char_to_children -> char -> trie -> char_to_children such that

children_from_char (update_children m c t) c = Some t ;
children_from_char (update_children m c t) c' = children_from_char m c' for c <> c';
If children_from_char m c = Some t then List.length (update_children m c t') = List.length m


```ocaml
type trie = Trie of int option * char_to_children
(* ie. a pair, int * list of pairs = int-(char-trie) PAIR *)

and char_to_children = (char * trie) list
(* ie. a list of pairs (char * trie) (char-trie) LIST *)

let rec children_from_char m char =
  match m, char with
  | [(a, Trie (x,y))], b when a = char -> Some (Trie (x,y))
  | (a, Trie(x,y))::rest, _ when a = char -> Some (Trie (x,y))
  | (a, Trie(x,y))::rest, _ -> children_from_char rest char
  | _ -> None
  ;;

let update_children list char t =
  if children_from_char list char = None then
    let el = (char, t) in
    el::list
  else list
;;

update_children
  [('g', Trie (None, [('m', Trie (Some 3, []))]));
   ('p', Trie (Some 1, [('g', Trie (None, [('a', Trie (Some 3, []))]))]))]
  'j'
  (Trie (Some 1,
    [('m', Trie (None, [('s', Trie (Some (-5), []))]));
     ('d', Trie (None, [('j', Trie (None, [('a', Trie (Some (-5), []))]))]));
     ('p', Trie (None, [('g', Trie (None, [('m', Trie (Some 2, []))]))]));
     ('j', Trie (None, [('j', Trie (Some (-5), []))]));
     ('a', Trie (Some 0, [('j', Trie (None, [('g', Trie (Some 1, []))]))]))]));;

update_children
  [('p', Trie (None, [('g', Trie (Some (-5), []))]));
   ('g', Trie (None, [('p', Trie (Some (-4), []))]));
   ('m',
    Trie (Some 0,
     [('d', Trie (None, [('g', Trie (Some 2, []))]));
      ('p', Trie (None, [('j', Trie (Some 0, []))]));
      ('g', Trie (None, [('s', Trie (Some (-4), []))]))]))]
  'p'
  (Trie (Some 1,
    [('d', Trie (None, [('j', Trie (Some (-1), []))]));
     ('a',
      Trie (None,
       [('s', Trie (Some (-1), []));
        ('m', Trie (None, [('p', Trie (Some (-1), []))]))]))]))

```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Quiz: Lookup
Write a function lookup : trie -> string -> int option such that lookup trie w = Some i if i is the value of the key w in trie and lookup trie w = None if w is not a key of trie.

To look for a key in a trie, iterate over the characters of the key from left to right.

Given the current character c and the current node of the trie n, look for the children n for character c.

If such a children exists, continue with that trie and the remainder of the key.

If no such children exists, the key is not in the trie.

When the characters of the key are entirely consumed, look at the root of the current trie.

If there is an integer, this is the value you are looking for.

If there is no integer, the key not in the trie.

```ocaml
