# Definitions

Definitions introduce names of identifiers, and BIND VALUES to them.

There are 2 forms of definitions in OCaml
- local definitions
- global definitions

Simultaneous definitions are useful....

------------------------------------------------------------
Definitions are used to give NAMES to VALUES
- a "handle" or "name" to retrieve storing, and also, retrieving values

A name is BOUND to a value.
A name is BOUND to an expression (which evaluates to a value).

------------------------------------------------------------
## Global Definitions
Global definitions are effective for the rest of the toplevel session
- effective for the duration of a session

Syntax
```ocaml
let name = expression
```

There is no separation declaration of identifiers
- there is no need to declare the TYPE of an identifier
- this is done by the system

Once set, the value of an identifier never changes

Once defined, an identifier can be used in expressions!
- After all, an identifer is a value!

------------------------------------------------------------
```
let x = 2+3;;
x;;
- : int = 5
```

It's fine to give a new global definition

A new global identifier with the same name.

We have defined a new identifier, which just happens to have the
same name as the old one.

The old identifier will be shadowed, and hidden for now.

When we ask for the value of x, it will be the LAST BINDING:
```
let x = 5;;
let x = 6;;
x;;
- 6
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Local Definitions
- naming with a delimited scope

Syntax
```ocaml
let name = exp1 in exp2
```

Here, the scope of name is exp2

SCOPE = the REACH of a PROGRAM

A local definition may temporarily hide a more global one.
- local definitions (the most inner / innermost) will have priority

```
let x = 4+5 in 2*x;;
x;;
Error: Unbound value x
```

The local definition is no longer visible once you leave the scope of the expression
```
let x = 17;;
let y = x+1 in y/18;;
- 1

x is accessible by the second phrase.
but y is defined only inside the second phrase
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Nested definitions

```
let x = 4 in
let y = x+1 in
let x = 2*y in x;;
```

- First, we define x
- Then, we define y, by referring to the x we just defined
- Then, we define a new identifer called x, which refers to y
- Then, we simply return "x" (the last "in" has the simple expression "x", just a value)
  - `x;;` - which is x

```
let x = 4 in
let y = x+1 in
  - y is 5 now
let x = 2*y in x;;
  - x = 10
```

```
let x = 4 in
(let x = 17 in x+1) + x;;
```

So, "in" means "And then, let's use that in..."
```
let x = 4 in
(let x = 17 in x+1) + x;;
    ^^ this inner evaluates to 18
  then, the outer evaluates to 18 + 4 ... 22
```

We can't access / re-use that last expression because it is not BOUND to anything.
It has no identifier / label.
The "let" is used, but only to define a LOCAL identifier, which after the expression
is evaluated is no longer accessible.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Visibility of definitions
```
let x = 1;;
.
.                 x = 1 here
.
let x = 2 in
  .
  .               x = 2 here
  .
  let x = 3 in
    .
    .             x = 3 here
    .
  .
  .               x = 2 here
  .
.
.                 x = 1 here
.
```

Local definitions HIDE more global definitions.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Simultaneous Definitions

let x = e
- First, e is evaluated in the environment which we have before the let
- ie. wrt (with respect to) the value bindings BEFORE the LET

let x1 = e1 and x2 = e2
- this is a simultaneous definition
- First, both e1 and e2 are evaluated
- in the old / existing environment
- Then, these values are bound to the identifiers
- both expressions are evaluated wrt the value bindings before the let

Same effect as
let x2 = e2 and x1 = e1
- ie. the ORDER doesn't matter in simultaneous definitions
- both expressions will be evaluated in the old environment

Works for both global and local definitions.

------------------------------------------------------------
```ocaml
let x = 1;;

(* sequential definitions *)
let x = 2 in
  let y = x + 1 in (* y = 2 + 1, ie. 3 *)
  x*y;; (* 2*3, ie. 6 *)
  (* we get the value 6, but it is not stored or accessible after this is evaluated *)

(* simultaneous definition *)
let x = 2
  and y = x + 1 in (* y = 1+1, we are using the OUTER definition of x here, x=1, ie. 1+1, ie. 2 *)
  x*y;; (* here, we are using the local definition of x, ie. x=2, ie. 2*2, ie. 4 *)
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Quiz: Integer Identifiers
Suppose that a variable x exists and is an integer.

Define a variable x_power_8 that uses three multiplications to calculate
x to the power of 8

```ocaml
let x = Random.int 9 + 1 (* ie. not 0 *)

```

2 ** 8
= 2 ** 2+2+4

x ** 8
x*x is x**2

x² = x * x
x⁴ = x² * x²
x⁸ = x⁴ * x⁴

let x_power_2 = x * x in
let x_power_4 = x_power_2 * x_power_2 ;;
- Syntax Error
- we need to "assign" (?) x_power_4 to something

let x_power_2 = x * x in
let x_power_4 = x_power_2 * x_power_2 in
x_power_4;;
  - simply have it return itself


```ocaml
let x_power_2 = x * x in
let x_power_4 = x_power_2 * x_power_2 in
let x_power_8 = x_power_4 * x_power_4 in
x_power_8;;
```

That is fine, but we can't access that final value.
all the variabes x_power_2, x_power_4, x_power_8 are LOCAL
they are "auxillary variables" / "local definitions"

We need to store it.
ie. we need to BIND it.
ie. we need a global identifier.

```ocaml
let x_power_8 =
  let x_power_2 = x * x in
  let x_power_4 = x_power_2 * x_power_2 in
  let x_power_8 = x_power_4 * x_power_4 in
  (* here, x_power_8 overrides the global definition *)
  x_power_8;;
  (* we are returning the local x_power_8 and using it as the value for the global x_power_8 *)
```


Or, like this:
```ocaml
let outer_x_power_8 =
  let inner_x_power_2 = x * x in
  let inner_x_power_4 = x_power_2 * x_power_2 in
  let inner_x_power_8 = x_power_4 * x_power_4 in
  inner_x_power_8;;
```
