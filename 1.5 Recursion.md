# Recursion

Recursive functions: functions that, in their definition, call themselves.

Calling itself on smaller arguments

Natural on recursively defined data structures (Week 3)

Example:
fact(n) =
  { 1                     if n = 1 }
  { n * fact(n - 1)       if n > 1 }


The next call(s) to "fact" are "smaller", such that at some point it will stop
fact(3) = 3 * fact(2)
  - 2 is smaller than 3

fact(2) = 2 * fact(1)

fact(1) = 1

so fact(2) = 2 * 1
so fact(3) = 3 * 2 = 6

------------------------------------------------------------
## Recursive definitions in OCaml
- A priory, the use of "f" in a definition of "f" refers to the PREVIOUS value of "f"
  - when we write down a definition using "let" then the expression you have on the right
  of the equality sign (ie. in the BODY) is always a priory evaluated in the environment which we had
  BEFORE the LET
  - this doesn't work if we want to write a recursive function because in a
    recursive function, the function used IN THE BODY refers to the function which you
    are currently defining (ie. the value of the arguments change, cf lexical scope)

  > A priori = knowledge or justification is independent of experience, as with:
    - mathematics (3 + 2 = 5),:
    - tautologies ("All bachelors are unmarried"), and:
    - deduction from pure reason (e.g., ontological proofs)
    - ... so, not requiring proof? (just believe it)

- IN THE EXPRESSION OF LET BINDING, THE EXPRESSION IS ALWAYS EVALUATED IN THE OLD ENVIRONMENT

- the keyword "rec" changes this, allowing us to define a function by recursion.
  - it allows us to refer to the function we are CURRENTLY DEFINING.

------------------------------------------------------------
```ocaml
let x = 1;;

(* 2nd binding for x *)
let x = x+1;;
(* binds x to the PREVIOUS value of x, ie. 1, so now, x = 2 *)

x;;
(* 2 *)
```

Same with functions:
```ocaml
(* 1st binding, the successor function *)
let f x = x+1;;

(* new binding, "f" here refers to the old "f" above *)
let f x = f (f x));;

f 1;;
(* this means
inner f x = 1+1 = 2
outer f 2 = 2+1 = 3
*)
```

Now let's see what happens with factorial
```ocaml
let fact n = if n <= 1 then 1 else n * fact (n - 1);;
- This will actually ERROR!
- Error: unbound value fact
- "fact" in the BODY is looking for a function "fact", but that has not been defined yet (we are defining it now!!!)

let rec fact n = if n <= 1 then 1 else n * fact (n - 1);;
fact 2;;
- 2 * fact (2 - 1)
- ie. 2 * fact(1)

fact(1) = 1

so, 2 * fact(1) = 2 * 1 = 2
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Mutually recursive functions
- Generalization of direct recursion
  - (direct recursion is what we did above with fact)
  - mutually recursive or simultaneously recursive
- several functions are defined by calling each other on smaller arguments
  - "smaller arguments" means that it will eventually STOP :)
- this is natural on mutual recursive data structures



- Example (one way of deciding if an integer is even / odd):
  - n is even if n = 0, or n > 0 and n - 1 is odd
  - n is odd if n = 1, or n > 1 and n - 1 is even

- ie. the definition of odd calls on the definition of even,
- and, the definition of even calls on the definition of odd

```ocaml
let rec even x = if x=0 then true else odd(x-1);;
- here, we are stuck.
- we haven't defined odd yet...
- Error: unbound error odd
- and the definition of odd will require the definition of even

let rec even x = if x=0 then true else odd(x-1)
and odd x = if x=0 then false else even(x-1);;

- we are using the keyword / operator "and"
- a SIMULTANEOUS DEFINITION = "and" allows multiple definitions to be defined at once
