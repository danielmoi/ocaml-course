# Recursion

Recursive functions: functions that, in their definition, call themselves.

Calling itself on smaller arguments

Natural on recursively defined data structures (Week 3)

Example:
fact(n) =
  { 1                     if n = 1 }
  { n * fact(n - 1)       if n > 1 }


The next call(s) to "fact" are "smaller", such that at some point it will stop
fact(3) = 3 * fact(2)
  - 2 is smaller than 3

fact(2) = 2 * fact(1)

fact(1) = 1

so fact(2) = 2 * 1
so fact(3) = 3 * 2 = 6

------------------------------------------------------------
## Recursive definitions in OCaml
- A priory, the use of "f" in a definition of "f" refers to the PREVIOUS value of "f"
  - when we write down a definition using "let" then the expression you have on the right
  of the equality sign (ie. in the BODY) is always a priory evaluated in the environment which we had
  BEFORE the LET
  - this doesn't work if we want to write a recursive function because in a
    recursive function, the function used IN THE BODY refers to the function which you
    are currently defining (ie. the value of the arguments change, cf lexical scope)

  > A priori = knowledge or justification is independent of experience, as with:
    - mathematics (3 + 2 = 5),:
    - tautologies ("All bachelors are unmarried"), and:
    - deduction from pure reason (e.g., ontological proofs)
    - ... so, not requiring proof? (just believe it)

- IN THE EXPRESSION OF LET BINDING, THE EXPRESSION IS ALWAYS EVALUATED IN THE OLD ENVIRONMENT

- the keyword "rec" changes this, allowing us to define a function by recursion.
  - it allows us to refer to the function we are CURRENTLY DEFINING.

------------------------------------------------------------
```ocaml
let x = 1;;

(* 2nd binding for x *)
let x = x+1;;
(* binds x to the PREVIOUS value of x, ie. 1, so now, x = 2 *)

x;;
(* 2 *)
```

Same with functions:
```ocaml
(* 1st binding, the successor function *)
let f x = x+1;;

(* new binding, "f" here refers to the old "f" above *)
let f x = f (f x));;

f 1;;
(* this means
inner f x = 1+1 = 2
outer f 2 = 2+1 = 3
*)
```

Now let's see what happens with factorial
```ocaml
let fact n = if n <= 1 then 1 else n * fact (n - 1);;
- This will actually ERROR!
- Error: unbound value fact
- "fact" in the BODY is looking for a function "fact", but that has not been defined yet (we are defining it now!!!)

let rec fact n = if n <= 1 then 1 else n * fact (n - 1);;
fact 2;;
- 2 * fact (2 - 1)
- ie. 2 * fact(1)

fact(1) = 1

so, 2 * fact(1) = 2 * 1 = 2
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Mutually recursive functions
- Generalization of direct recursion
  - (direct recursion is what we did above with fact)
  - mutually recursive or simultaneously recursive
- several functions are defined by calling each other on smaller arguments
  - "smaller arguments" means that it will eventually STOP :)
- this is natural on mutual recursive data structures



- Example (one way of deciding if an integer is even / odd):
  - n is even if n = 0, or n > 0 and n - 1 is odd
  - n is odd if n = 1, or n > 1 and n - 1 is even

- ie. the definition of odd calls on the definition of even,
- and, the definition of even calls on the definition of odd

```ocaml
let rec even x = if x=0 then true else odd(x-1);;
- here, we are stuck.
- we haven't defined odd yet...
- Error: unbound error odd
- and the definition of odd will require the definition of even

let rec even x = if x=0 then true else odd(x-1)
and odd x = if x=0 then false else even(x-1);;

- we are using the keyword / operator "and"
- a SIMULTANEOUS DEFINITION = "and" allows multiple definitions to be defined at once

```

## Quiz: GCD
gcd takes 2 non-negative integers n and m, and that returns the greatest common
divisor of n and m, following Euclid's algorithm

First pass:
```ocaml
let rec gcd n m =
  let larger = if n > m then n else m in
  let smaller = if n > m then m else n in
  let result = larger / smaller in
  let remainer = larger mod smaller in
  if remainer = 0 then smaller else gcd result smaller;;
```

```ocaml
let rec gcd n m =
  let larger = if n > m then n else m in
  let smaller = if n > m then m else n in
  let result = larger / smaller in
  let remainer = larger mod smaller in
  if remainer = 0 then result else gcd result smaller;;
```

```
gcd 100 3
100 / 3 = 33 + 1
33 / 3 = 11 + 0
```

Some errors:
```ocaml
let rec gcd n m =
  let larger = if n > m then n else m in
  let smaller = if n > m then m else n in
  let multiplier = larger / smaller in
  let remainder = larger mod smaller in
  if remainder = 0 then smaller else gcd smaller remainder;;

gcd 10 12;;
gcd 3 19;;

(*
larger = times * smaller + remainder

larger = multiplier * multiplicand + remainder
12 = 1 * 10 + 2
10 = 5 * 2  + 0


*)
```

Turns out that we don't use multiplier!!!

```ocaml
let rec gcd n m =
  let larger = if n > m then n else m in
  let smaller = if n > m then m else n in
  let remainder = larger mod smaller in
  if remainder = 0 then smaller else gcd smaller remainder;;
```



## Quiz: Multiple upto
multiple_upto n r
multiple_upto : int -> int -> bool that takes 2 non-negative integers n and r
and that tells whether n admits at least one divisor between 2 and r, inclusive.

In other words, that there exists a number d >= 2 and d <= r such that the remainder
of the division of n by d is zero


multiple_upto 100 2
50 or 25 or 10 etc


Realised this was for recursion:
```ocaml
let rec multiple_upto n r =
  let larger = if n > r then n else r in
  let smaller = if n > r then r else n in
  if smaller < 2 then false
  else if smaller > larger then false
  else if larger mod smaller = 0 then true
  else multiple_upto larger (smaller - 1)
;;

multiple_upto 5 7;;
(*
5 7 false
5 6 false
5 5 true
*)

10 3
(*
10 3 false
10 2 true
*)
```

But multiple_upto 5 7 is supposed to be true.
So I have misunderstood the question.
Went through the test cases...
So let's not rearrange with larger smaller.

```ocaml
let rec multiple_upto n r =
  if r < 2 then false
  else if n mod r = 0 then true
  else multiple_upto n (r - 1)
;;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Quiz: is Prime
is_prime takes a non-negative integer n and checks whether it is a prime number.

For very small numbers (less than a million), trial division is the best way: divide by 2, 3, 5, and so on until the square root of the number. If you find a factor, the number is composite; otherwise, the number is prime.
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/5277/determine-whether-a-number-is-prime

We will start at sqrt root and go backwards

```ocaml
let rec is_prime n =
  let int_sqrt = integer_square_root n in
  if int_sqrt * int_sqrt = n then false
  else if multiple_upto n int_sqrt then false
  else true
;;
is_prime 1;;
is_prime 2;;
is_prime 19;;
is_prime 41;;
is_prime 67;;
is_prime 7;;
is_prime 8;;
is_prime 4;;
is_prime 9;;
(*
int_sqrt = 5
           *)
```

so for 48
int_sqrt = 6
6 * 6 != 48
multiple_upto 48 6 true (6)

so for 47
int_sqrt = 6
6 * 6 != 47
multiple_upto 47 6 false
multiple_upto 47 5 false
multiple_upto 47 4 false
multiple_upto 47 3 false
multiple_upto 47 2 false
so false
is prime
