# Tagged Values

- List is a ubiquitous data structure in FP
- the type for lists is simply a RECURSIVE algebraic data type

In the database example, we had
  engine : database -> query -> status * database * contact

The returned database and contact are meaningful only if the
returned status is true... otherwise they must not be used.

What if a type could capture this constraint?

------------------------------------------------------------
## Sum type: dISJOINT UNION of type
- We should change the type of engine into:
  engine : database -> query -> query_result

- Such a value of type query_result can be either
  - an error
  - a new database (in the case of a successful insertion or deletion query)
  - a contact and its index (in the case of a search query)

- In OCaml, this is written as a SUM TYPE:
```ocaml
type query_result =
  | Error
  | NewDatabase of database
  | FoundContact of contact * int

```

```ocaml
type some_type_identifier =
| SomeTag of some_type * ... * some_type
| ...
| SomeTag of some_type * ... * some_type

```

- SomeTag is a TAG IDENTIFIER, and must start with an uppercase letter
- Tag identifiers must be unique and distinct
- A tag characterizes ONE SPECIFIC TYPE in this disjoint union of types

-------------------------------------------------------------
## Constructing tagged values
- Tags are also called CONSTRUCTORS
- a tag is used as a MARKER to CLASSIFY values with respect to the
different cases of the union

```ocaml
let result = SomeTag (some_expression, ..., some_expression)
```

- Parentheses can be omitted if there is only ONE argument, and if that
argument is a SIMPLE expression (like a variable / literal)

```ocaml
type contact = {
  name: string;
  phone: int * int * int * int
};;

type query =
  | Insert of contact
  | Delete of contact
  | Search of string;;

let luke = { name: "luke"; phone: (1, 2, 3, 4) }

let query1 = Insert luke;;

let query2 = Search "luke";;

let query3 = Delete luke;;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Another example
```ocaml
type color = Black | Gray | White;;
- this is a type with constructors that have no arguments at all

let batman_color = Black;;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Observing tagged values by case analysis

Let type t = A  | B
and x be an identifier of type t

- x must have been constructed using A or B
- then, we know that x can either be A or B
- if we want to write some computation that depends on x, we must
  provide some code for the case x = A and some code for the case
  x = B

- in exchange for the safety of the constraint, we have to cover all use cases

- so, when we observe a value of a SUM TYPE, SEVERAL CASES are possible
- the programmer must provide an expression for EACH possible case
- a case is described, as usual, by a PATTERN, of the form:
  SomeTag (some_pattern, ..., some_pattern)
- a BRANCH is composed of a PATTERN and an EXPRESSION separated by an arrow:
  some_pattern -> some_expression


------------------------------------------------------------
## Case analysis by pattern matching
- a pattern matching is a SEQUENCE of BRANCHES:
- we use the keywords "match" and "with":
```ocaml
let result = match some_expression with
| some_pattern -> some_expression
| some_pattern -> some_expression
| ...
| some_pattern -> some_expression
```

- there must be at least ONE branch in a PATTERN MATCHING

- to evaluate a pattern matching:
  - we compute the value of some expression
  - we try to match it with the pattern of the 1st branch
  - if it does not, we try the next one, until we find a match
  - upon a match, we execute the expression of that branch

------------------------------------------------------------
## A pattern matching

```ocaml
let engine db query =
  match query with
    | Insert contact -> insert db contact
    | Delete contact -> delete db contact
    | Search name -> search db name;;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Functions defined by cases
- Many functions start with a case analysis over one argument:
```ocaml
let f x = match x with
  | some_pattern -> some_expression
  | ...
  | some_pattern -> some_expression
```

There is syntactic shortcut to define them (because this is such
a common use case for functions)
```ocaml
let f = function
  | some_pattern -> some_expression
  | ...
  | some_pattern -> some_expression
```

Example:
```ocaml
let engine db query = function
  | Insert contact -> insert db contact
  | Delete contact -> delete db contact
  | Search name -> search db name;;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## In the machine
- Each tag is represented by a (small) machine INTEGER:
- a value of a sum type is either
  - a tag, if it is a constructor with no argument
  - or, a heap-allocated block, starting with a tag

- pattern matching performs a dynamic test on this tag

------------------------------------------------------------
## Pitfalls
- a pattern can be ill-typed
- a case analysis can be non-exhaustive
- all these programming errors ARE caught by the type checker!!

------------------------------------------------------------
```ocaml
type data =
  | None
  | Single of int
  | Pair of int * int;;

  - NB. the first pipe | is optional

let bad_arity (x: data) =
  match x with
    | None x -> x
       - this is an error
       - this pattern applies None to one argument, but it expects no arguments
    | Single x -> x
    | Pair (x, _) -> x;;

let bad_argument_type (x: data) =
  match x with
    | Single true -> false
      - this is an error
      - Single is applied to true, which is a Boolean,
      - but in the declaration, we have said that it expects an integer
    | _ -> true;;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
```ocaml
type color = Black | Gray | White;;

(* Black < Gray < White and forall x, not (x < x). *)
let lighter c1 c2 =
  match (c1, c2) with
    | (Black, Black) -> false
    | (Gray, Gray) -> false
    | (White, White) -> false
    | (Black, _) -> true
    | (_, White) -> true
    | (White, Gray) -> false
    | (Gray, Black) -> false;;
```

- for 2 values with 3 options, there are 8 possible permutations
- the typechecker will catch this
- in the above example, we have missed (White, Black)
