# Tagged Values

- List is a ubiquitous data structure in FP
- the type for lists is simply a RECURSIVE algebraic data type

In the database example, we had
  engine : database -> query -> status * database * contact

The returned database and contact are meaningful only if the
returned status is true... otherwise they must not be used.

What if a type could capture this constraint?

------------------------------------------------------------
## Sum type: dISJOINT UNION of type
- We should change the type of engine into:
  engine : database -> query -> query_result

- Such a value of type query_result can be either
  - an error
  - a new database (in the case of a successful insertion or deletion query)
  - a contact and its index (in the case of a search query)

- In OCaml, this is written as a SUM TYPE:
```ocaml
type query_result =
  | Error
  | NewDatabase of database
  | FoundContact of contact * int

```

```ocaml
type some_type_identifier =
| SomeTag of some_type * ... * some_type
| ...
| SomeTag of some_type * ... * some_type

```

- SomeTag is a TAG IDENTIFIER, and must start with an uppercase letter
- Tag identifiers must be unique and distinct
- A tag characterizes ONE SPECIFIC TYPE in this disjoint union of types

-------------------------------------------------------------
## Constructing tagged values
- Tags are also called CONSTRUCTORS
- a tag is used as a MARKER to CLASSIFY values with respect to the
different cases of the union

```ocaml
let result = SomeTag (some_expression, ..., some_expression)
```

- Parentheses can be omitted if there is only ONE argument, and if that
argument is a SIMPLE expression (like a variable / literal)

```ocaml
type contact = {
  name: string;
  phone: int * int * int * int
};;

type query =
  | Insert of contact
  | Delete of contact
  | Search of string;;

let luke = { name: "luke"; phone: (1, 2, 3, 4) }

let query1 = Insert luke;;

let query2 = Search "luke";;

let query3 = Delete luke;;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Another example
```ocaml
type color = Black | Gray | White;;
- this is a type with constructors that have no arguments at all

let batman_color = Black;;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Observing tagged values by case analysis

Let type t = A  | B
and x be an identifier of type t

- x must have been constructed using A or B
- then, we know that x can either be A or B
- if we want to write some computation that depends on x, we must
  provide some code for the case x = A and some code for the case
  x = B

- in exchange for the safety of the constraint, we have to cover all use cases

- so, when we observe a value of a SUM TYPE, SEVERAL CASES are possible
- the programmer must provide an expression for EACH possible case
- a case is described, as usual, by a PATTERN, of the form:
  SomeTag (some_pattern, ..., some_pattern)
- a BRANCH is composed of a PATTERN and an EXPRESSION separated by an arrow:
  some_pattern -> some_expression


------------------------------------------------------------
## Case analysis by pattern matching
- a pattern matching is a SEQUENCE of BRANCHES:
- we use the keywords "match" and "with":
```ocaml
let result = match some_expression with
| some_pattern -> some_expression
| some_pattern -> some_expression
| ...
| some_pattern -> some_expression
```

- there must be at least ONE branch in a PATTERN MATCHING

- to evaluate a pattern matching:
  - we compute the value of some expression
  - we try to match it with the pattern of the 1st branch
  - if it does not, we try the next one, until we find a match
  - upon a match, we execute the expression of that branch

------------------------------------------------------------
## A pattern matching

```ocaml
let engine db query =
  match query with
    | Insert contact -> insert db contact
    | Delete contact -> delete db contact
    | Search name -> search db name;;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Functions defined by cases
- Many functions start with a case analysis over one argument:
```ocaml
let f x = match x with
  | some_pattern -> some_expression
  | ...
  | some_pattern -> some_expression
```

There is syntactic shortcut to define them (because this is such
a common use case for functions)
```ocaml
let f = function
  | some_pattern -> some_expression
  | ...
  | some_pattern -> some_expression
```

Example:
```ocaml
let engine db query = function
  | Insert contact -> insert db contact
  | Delete contact -> delete db contact
  | Search name -> search db name;;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## In the machine
- Each tag is represented by a (small) machine INTEGER:
- a value of a sum type is either
  - a tag, if it is a constructor with no argument
  - or, a heap-allocated block, starting with a tag

- pattern matching performs a dynamic test on this tag

------------------------------------------------------------
## Pitfalls
- a pattern can be ill-typed
- a case analysis can be non-exhaustive
- all these programming errors ARE caught by the type checker!!

------------------------------------------------------------
```ocaml
type data =
  | None
  | Single of int
  | Pair of int * int;;

  - NB. the first pipe | is optional

let bad_arity (x: data) =
  match x with
    | None x -> x
       - this is an error
       - this pattern applies None to one argument, but it expects no arguments
    | Single x -> x
    | Pair (x, _) -> x;;

let bad_argument_type (x: data) =
  match x with
    | Single true -> false
      - this is an error
      - Single is applied to true, which is a Boolean,
      - but in the declaration, we have said that it expects an integer
    | _ -> true;;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
```ocaml
type color = Black | Gray | White;;

(* Black < Gray < White and forall x, not (x < x). *)
let lighter c1 c2 =
  match (c1, c2) with
    | (Black, Black) -> false
    | (Gray, Gray) -> false
    | (White, White) -> false
    | (Black, _) -> true
    | (_, White) -> true
    | (White, Gray) -> false
    | (Gray, Black) -> false;;
```

- for 2 values with 3 options, there are 8 possible permutations
- the typechecker will catch this
- in the above example, we have missed (White, Black)

------------------------------------------------------------
## Quiz: Pattern matching exhaustivity
We have seen in the course the example of non exhaustive pattern matching given below. Write the code for the missing cases.
The given prelude

```ocaml
type color = Black | Gray | White ;;

let lighter c1 c2 =
  match (c1, c2) with
  | (Black, Black) -> false
  | (White, White) -> false
  | (Gray, Gray) -> false
  | (Black, _) -> true
  | (_, White) -> true
  | (White, Black) ->false (* added this one *)
  | (White, Gray) -> false
  | (Gray, Black) -> false
;;
```

## A type for array indices

 The previous week, we asked you the following question: Consider a non empty array of integers a, write a function min_index : int array -> int that returns the index of the minimal element of a.
As the arrays contain integers and the indices of arrays are also represented by integers, you might have confused an index and the content of a cell. To avoid such a confusion, let us define a type for index (given in the prelude below).
This type has a single constructor waiting for one integer.
For instance, if you want to represent the index 0, use the value Index 0.
Defining such a type is interesting because it allows the type-checker to check that an integer is not used where an index is expected (or the converse).

Write a function read : int array -> index -> int such that read a (Index k) returns the k-th element of a.
```ocaml
type index = Index of int;;

Incorrect:
let read int array =
  match int Index with
  | array.get(Index);;

Correct:
let read a (Index int) =
  a.(int);;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
 Write a function inside : int array -> index -> bool such that inside a idx is true if and only if idx is a valid index for the array a.

```ocaml

Wrong:
let inside a (Index int) =
  match int with
  | int > Array.length a -> false
  | -> true;;


let inside a (Index int) =
  if int > Array.length a - 1 then false
  else true;;

let inside a (Index int) =
  match int with
  | -1 -> false;;
  - not exhaustive


Can't do this... why?
let inside a (Index int) =
  match int with
  | (int < -1) -> false;;


let inside a (Index int) =
  if int < 0 then false
  else if int > Array.length a -1 then false
  else true;;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
Write a function next : index -> index such that next (Index k) is equal to Index (k + 1).

```ocaml
let next (Index int) =
  int + 1;;
- val next : index -> int = <fun>

let next (Index int) =
  Index int + 1;;
- Error: This expression has type index but an expression was expected of type
         int


let next (Index int) =
  Index (int + 1);;
val next : index -> index = <fun>
```

------------------------------------------------------------
Consider a non empty array of integers a, write a function min_index : int array -> index that returns the index of the minimal element of a.

```ocaml
let min a =
  let result = Array.fold_left
    (fun x y ->
      if (x > y) then y
      else x
    )
    max_int
    a
  in result
;;

let rec get_index a index value =
  if (a.(index) = value) then index
  else get_index a (index + 1) value

let min_index a =
  let min_value = min a in
  let result = get_index a 0 min_value
  in Index(result);;

let min_index a =
  let min_value = min a in
  let result = get_index a 0 min_value
  in Index result;;


type numbers =
| Positive of int;;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## The Option Type
Optional values are commonly used in OCaml in the return type of partial functions, i.e. functions that may fail on some input. The following questions illustrate such situations.
In the Pervasives module which is loaded automatically, there is a type option with two constructors:

Some (e) has type 't option if e has type 't and represents the presence of some value e of type 't.
None has type 't option and represents the absence of some value of type 't.

------------------------------------------------------------
Write a function find : string array -> string -> int option such that
- find a w = Some idx if a.(idx) = w
- find a w = None if there is no such index.

`option` is a TYPE.
So it is a type with two CONSTRUCTORS (ie. type-types)
- Some
- None

```ocaml
let find arr word =
  Array.fold_left
  (fun res next ->
    if res <> "" then res
    else if next = word then word
    else ""
  )
  ""
  arr
```

```ocaml
let find arr word =
  let result = Array.fold_left
  (fun arr v ->
    if v = word then Some word
    else None
  )
  None
  arr
  in result;;

- val find : 'a array -> 'a -> 'a option = <fun>
```


```ocaml
let find arr word =
  let result = Array.fold_left
  (fun res next ->
    if res <> "" then res
    else if next = word then word
    else ""
  )
  ""
  arr

  in
  if result <> "" then Some result
  else None;;

find [| "Cookies" ; "Cake" ; "Buns"; |] "Buns";;
```

Need to return the INDEX, not the word
```ocaml
let rec get_index arr index value =
  let len = Array.length arr in
  if index > len  - 1 then -1
  else if (arr.(index) = value) then index
  else get_index arr (index + 1) value;;

let find arr word =
  let index = get_index arr 0 word in
  if index = -1 then None
  else Some index;;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
Sometimes, when a value of type t is missing, a default value should be used.
Write a function default_int : int option -> int
such that: default_int None = 0 and default_int (Some x) = x.

NUP
```ocaml
let default_int a =
  if None then 0
  else a;;
```
```ocaml
let default_int option a =
  if a = None then 0
  else a;;
  Error: This expression has type 'a option
       but an expression was expected of type int
```

```ocaml
let default_int a =
  if option a = None then 0
  else a;;
  Error: Unbound value option
```

```ocaml
let default_int a =
  match a with
    | None -> 0
    | Some a -> a;;
```
------------------------------------------------------------
Write a function merge : int option -> int option -> int option such that:
- merge None None = None
- merge (Some x) None = merge None (Some x) = Some x
- merge (Some x) (Some y) = Some (x + y)

```ocaml
let merge a b =
  match (a, b) with
  | (None, None) -> None
  | (Some a, None) -> Some a
  | (None, Some b) -> Some b
  | (Some a, Some b) -> Some (a + b);;


merge (Some 2) None;;
- : int option = Some 2
```
