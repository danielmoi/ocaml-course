# Records

In a tuple, each component is referred using its POSITION.
This may be error-prone - it is easy use a wrong index.

Record types allow each component to be NAMED.
This makes the code more readable because field names have more meaning
than positional reference.

------------------------------------------------------------
```ocaml
type point2D = { x: int; y: int };;
- we define a FIELD "x" and another FIELD "y"

let origin = { x = 0; y = 0 };;
- we give the value for each field
- based on this, OCaml can actually INFER the type!
- val origin : point2D = { x = 0; y = 0 }

let from_tuple (x, y) = { x; y };;
- this is shorthand for:
- let from_type (x, y) = { x = x, y = y };;

let a : point2D = from_tuple (4, 2);;

let b : point2D = from_tuple (10, 5);;

(* another record type *)
type box = {
  left_upper_corner: point2D;
  right_lower_corner: point2D;
};;

let the_box = {
  left_upper_corner = a;
  right_lower_corner = b;
};;

let get_min_x { left_upper_corner = { x } } = x;;
- we "observe" (get) the value of this left upper corner, by writing a PATTERN
  - left_upper_corner
- to observe the "x" value, we write another PATTERN
  - x
- and we will just RETURN the value of "x"
- val get_min_x : box -> int = <fun>
- so we pass in a BOX and get back an int

```

## Syntax to declare a record type
- Contract to tuples, RECORD types must be DECLARED
- this is because of the extra checks that the compile does

- to declare a record type:
```ocaml
type some_type_identifier = {
  field_name: some_type;
  ...
  field_name: some_type;
};;
```

- one constraint: all field names must be distinct
- and preferably UNUSED in other record types!

------------------------------------------------------------
## Syntax to construct a record type
- To construct a record:
```ocaml
let my_record = {
  field_name = some_expression;
  ...;
  field_name = some_expression;
}
```
- we use an EQUALS sign


------------------------------------------------------------
## Syntax to observe a record type
- To observe a SPECIFIC field of a record, we use dot notation
```ocaml
some_expression.field_name
```

- To observe SEVERAL fields of a record, we use RECORD PATTERNS:
```ocaml
{
  field_name = some_pattern;
  ...;
  field_name = some_pattern;
}
```
- what is nice, is that you don't have to mention ALL the record fields!
  - only the fields you want to observe

------------------------------------------------------------
## In the machine
- a record is represented by a HEAP-ALLOCATED BLOCK
- just like a TUPLE

------------------------------------------------------------
## Pitfalls: Typo in a field name
- Using type declaration, the compiler IS able to detect typos in field identifiers

------------------------------------------------------------
```ocaml
type point2D = {
  x: int;
  y: int;
};;

let = { x = 42; z: 3 };;
- compiler detects
- Error: unbound record field z
```

```ocaml
type point2D = { x: int; y: int };;

let oups = { x = 0 };;
- Error: some record fields are undefined: y

```
------------------------------------------------------------
## Pitfalls: Ill-typed field definition
- the value of all fields must be compatible with the field type
  as declared by the record type definition

```ocaml
type person = {
  name: string;
  age: int;
};;
let luke = {
  name: "Skywalker";
  age: "26";
};;
- Error: this expression has type string but an expression was expected of type int
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Pitfalls: Shadowing a field name
- The compiler does its best to disambiguate the usage of labels
- but sometimes the ambiguity cannot be fixed (and the ambiguity is
  probably NOT intended by the programmer)

```ocaml
type a = { x: int; b: int; };;
type b = { y: int; c: int; };;

let one = { x = 0; b = 2; };;
- the compiler knows it's type "a"
- : a = { x = 0; b = 2 };;

type t = { x: bool };;

let two = { x = true };;
- the compiler knows it's type "t"
- : t = { x = true };;

type u = { x: int; };;

let three = { x = true };;
- now, OCaml will reject the program
- type error
- Error: this expression has type bool, but an expression was expected
  of type int
- the field "x" does not have the type with respect to the LAST definition
  of a record with only one field, of this name...
- it's complex
- best: don't share field names between records

```

## Quiz: Points and vectors

Write a function move : point -> dpoint -> point
such that move d dp is the point p whose coordinates have been updated
according to dp
(x is now x +. dx, y is now y +. dy, z is now z +. dz)

```ocaml

type point = { x: float; y: float; z: float };;
type dpoint = { dx: float; dy: float; dz: float };;
type physical_object =  { position: point; velocity: dpoint };;

let move d dp = {
  x = d.x +. dp.dx;
  y = d.y +. dp.dy;
  z = d.z +. dp.dz;
};;
```

The same, with explicit types:
```ocaml
let move (d: point) (dp: dpoint) = {
  x = d.x +. dp.dx;
  y = d.y +. dp.dy;
  z = d.z +. dp.dz;
};;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
Write a function next : physical_object -> physical_object such that next o is the physical object o at time t + dt.
The position of next o is the position of o moved according to its velocity vector.

```ocaml
let next obj = {
  position = { move obj.position obj.velocity }
}


```

We can do this:
```ocaml
let will_collide_soon (p1: physical_object) (p2: physical_object) =
  p1.position.x < (next p2).position.x;;
```

## Quiz: Time on planet Shadokus
On planet Shadokus,
a year has 5 months,
each month has 4 days,
each day has 3 hours and
each hour has 2 minutes.
A calendar date is therefore defined as the record type date of the given prelude.

A date is well-formed if its year index is >= 1, its month index is >= 1 and <= 5, its day index is >= 1 and <= 4, its hour index is >= 0 and <= 2, and its minute index is >= 0 and <= 1.
The start of year 12 would be:

```
{ year = 12; month = 1; day = 1; hour = 0; minute = 0 }
```

The end of year 12 would be:

```
{ year = 12; month = 5; day = 4; hour = 2; minute = 1 }
```


```ocaml
type date =
  { year : int; month : int; day : int;
    hour : int; minute : int }


```
Write a function wellformed : date -> bool which checks that the input date is well formed.
```ocaml
let wellformed date =
  date.year >= 1 &&
  date.month >=1 && date.month <= 5 &&
  date.day >= 1 && date.day <= 4 &&
  date.hour >= 0 && date.hour <= 2 &&
  date.minute >= 0 && date.minute <=1
;;

wellformed {year = 1; month = 1; day = 1; hour = 1; minute = -1};;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
On planet Shadokus, the origin of time is the discovery of the
Big-Lambda-Machine, a magical computer that evaluates the infinite lambda-term
of time. It is defined by value the_origin_of_time of the given prelude. Write a
function next : date -> date which computes the date which comes one minute
after the input date.

```ocaml
type date =
  { year : int; month : int; day : int;
    hour : int; minute : int };;

let the_origin_of_time = {
  year = 1;
  month = 1;
  day = 1;
  hour = 0;
  minute = 0;
};;

let mins_in_hour = 2;;
let hours_in_day = 3;;
let days_in_month = 4;;
let months_in_year = 5;;

let mins_in_day = hours_in_day * mins_in_hour;; (* 6 *)
let mins_in_month = days_in_month * mins_in_day;; (* 24 *)
let mins_in_year = months_in_year * mins_in_month;; (* 120 *)

let hours_to_mins hours = hours * mins_in_hour;;
let days_to_mins days = hours_to_mins days * hours_in_day;;
let months_to_mins months = days_to_mins months * days_in_month;;
let years_to_mins years = months_to_mins years * months_in_year;;

let total_minutes date =
  date.minute +
  hours_to_mins date.hour +
  days_to_mins date.day +
  months_to_mins date.month +
  years_to_mins date.year
;;

let num_years mins = mins / mins_in_year;;
let num_months mins = mins / mins_in_month;;
let num_days min = mins / mins_in_day;;
let num_hours min = mins / mins_in_hour;;

let remaining_mins mins div = mins mod div;;

let minutes_to_date mins =
  print_int mins;
  let year = mins / mins_in_year in
  let remaining_mins_year = mins mod mins_in_year in
  print_int remaining_mins_year;
  print_newline;
  let month = remaining_mins_year / mins_in_month in
  {
    year = year;
    month = month;
    day = 0;
    hour = 0;
    minute = 0;
  };;

let next mins = minutes_to_date mins;;
next 120;;


let next date =
  (* let mins = total_minutes date in *)
  let mins = 241 in
  (* print_int mins; *)
  minutes_to_date mins
;;

let the_origin_of_time = {
  year = 1;
  month = 1;
  day = 1;
  hour = 0;
  minute = 0;
};;


next {year = 0; month = 0; day = 0; hour = 0; minute = 1};;
next {year = 1; month = 5; day = 3; hour = 2; minute = 0};;
```
