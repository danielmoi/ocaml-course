# Records

In a tuple, each component is referred using its POSITION.
This may be error-prone - it is easy use a wrong index.

Record types allow each component to be NAMED.
This makes the code more readable because field names have more meaning
than positional reference.

------------------------------------------------------------
```ocaml
type point2D = { x: int; y: int };;
- we define a FIELD "x" and another FIELD "y"

let origin = { x = 0; y = 0 };;
- we give the value for each field
- based on this, OCaml can actually INFER the type!
- val origin : point2D = { x = 0; y = 0 }

let from_tuple (x, y) = { x; y };;
- this is shorthand for:
- let from_type (x, y) = { x = x, y = y };;

let a : point2D = from_tuple (4, 2);;

let b : point2D = from_tuple (10, 5);;

(* another record type *)
type box = {
  left_upper_corner: point2D;
  right_lower_corner: point2D;
};;

let the_box = {
  left_upper_corner = a;
  right_lower_corner = b;
};;

let get_min_x { left_upper_corner = { x } } = x;;
- we "observe" (get) the value of this left upper corner, by writing a PATTERN
  - left_upper_corner
- to observe the "x" value, we write another PATTERN
  - x
- and we will just RETURN the value of "x"
- val get_min_x : box -> int = <fun>
- so we pass in a BOX and get back an int

```

## Syntax to declare a record type
- Contract to tuples, RECORD types must be DECLARED
- this is because of the extra checks that the compile does

- to declare a record type:
```ocaml
type some_type_identifier = {
  field_name: some_type;
  ...
  field_name: some_type;
};;
```

- one constraint: all field names must be distinct
- and preferably UNUSED in other record types!

------------------------------------------------------------
## Syntax to construct a record type
- To construct a record:
```ocaml
let my_record = {
  field_name = some_expression;
  ...;
  field_name = some_expression;
}
```
- we use an EQUALS sign


------------------------------------------------------------
## Syntax to observe a record type
- To observe a SPECIFIC field of a record, we use dot notation
```ocaml
some_expression.field_name
```

- To observe SEVERAL fields of a record, we use RECORD PATTERNS:
```ocaml
{
  field_name = some_pattern;
  ...;
  field_name = some_pattern;
}
```
- what is nice, is that you don't have to mention ALL the record fields!
  - only the fields you want to observe

------------------------------------------------------------
## In the machine
- a record is represented by a HEAP-ALLOCATED BLOCK
- just like a TUPLE

------------------------------------------------------------
## Pitfalls: Typo in a field name
- Using type declaration, the compiler IS able to detect typos in field identifiers

------------------------------------------------------------
```ocaml
type point2D = {
  x: int;
  y: int;
};;

let = { x = 42; z: 3 };;
- compiler detects
- Error: unbound record field z
```

```ocaml
type point2D = { x: int; y: int };;

let oups = { x = 0 };;
- Error: some record fields are undefined: y

```
------------------------------------------------------------
## Pitfalls: Ill-typed field definition
- the value of all fields must be compatible with the field type
  as declared by the record type definition

```ocaml
type person = {
  name: string;
  age: int;
};;
let luke = {
  name: "Skywalker";
  age: "26";
};;
- Error: this expression has type string but an expression was expected of type int
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Pitfalls: Shadowing a field name
- The compiler does its best to disambiguate the usage of labels
- but sometimes the ambiguity cannot be fixed (and the ambiguity is
  probably NOT intended by the programmer)

```ocaml
type a = { x: int; b: int; };;
type b = { y: int; c: int; };;

let one = { x = 0; b = 2; };;
- the compiler knows it's type "a"
- : a = { x = 0; b = 2 };;

type t = { x: bool };;

let two = { x = true };;
- the compiler knows it's type "t"
- : t = { x = true };;

type u = { x: int; };;

let three = { x = true };;
- now, OCaml will reject the program
- type error
- Error: this expression has type bool, but an expression was expected
  of type int
- the field "x" does not have the type with respect to the LAST definition
  of a record with only one field, of this name...
- it's complex
- best: don't share field names between records

```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Quiz: Points and vectors

Write a function move : point -> dpoint -> point
such that move d dp is the point p whose coordinates have been updated
according to dp
(x is now x +. dx, y is now y +. dy, z is now z +. dz)

```ocaml

type point = { x: float; y: float; z: float };;
type dpoint = { dx: float; dy: float; dz: float };;
type physical_object =  { position: point; velocity: dpoint };;

let move d dp = {
  x = d.x +. dp.dx;
  y = d.y +. dp.dy;
  z = d.z +. dp.dz;
};;
```

The same, with explicit types:
```ocaml
let move (d: point) (dp: dpoint) = {
  x = d.x +. dp.dx;
  y = d.y +. dp.dy;
  z = d.z +. dp.dz;
};;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
Write a function next : physical_object -> physical_object such that next o is the physical object o at time t + dt.
The position of next o is the position of o moved according to its velocity vector.

```ocaml
let next obj = {
  position = { move obj.position obj.velocity }
}


```

We can do this:
```ocaml
let will_collide_soon (p1: physical_object) (p2: physical_object) =
  p1.position.x < (next p2).position.x;;
```
