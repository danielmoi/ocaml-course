# Basic Data Structures

We can structure code and data with TYPES.

Types are not only useful to document programs using type abbreviatesion
but also to inform the compiler about the SHAPE of values, so that it can
statically check that they are properly used.

This week, we will look at FLAT data, like tuples, records, arrays.

We will also implement a toy typed database!
