# Recursive Types

LIST is a ubiquitous data structure in FP.

The TYPE for a list is a recursive algebraic datatype.

------------------------------------------------------------
In Computer Science, many data structures like lists or trees have an UNBOUND
DEPTH.

For the moment, we are unable to define a type for such data structures because
we only have seen "flat" data types...

Informally, a list of integers is either:
- an empty list
- an integer, and the REST of the list

We already know how to define a type by cases using SUM TYPES, which is what
that looks like.

What we have to realize is that the REST of the list, is ALSO a LIST...

So we just have to reuse the name of the type inside of the type definition!

------------------------------------------------------------
```ocaml
type int_list =
  | EmptyList
  | SomeElement of int * int_list;;
                        ^ we are re-using the name, so this is a recursive type
```

Where
- int_list is a SUM TYPE
- EmptyList and SomeElement are TAG IDENTIFIERs
  - when we use a tag identifier to construct a value, it is called a CONSTRUCTOR
  - and int * int_list is an expression


------------------------------------------------------------
## In the machine
The following value,
```ocaml
SomeElement (1, SomeElement (3, EmptyList))
```

That implements a LINKED LIST data structure.

SomeElement 1 [ x ]
                |
                |---------------> SomeElement 3 EmptyList


Where x is a POINTER to another list.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Recursive Types
A SUM TYPED can refer to itsself in its own definition

Such a sum type is therefore recursive

Functions over a recursive type are often defined by CASE ANALYSIS and RECURSION

------------------------------------------------------------
## Recursive types
```ocaml
type int_list =
  | EmptyList
  | SomeElement of int * int_list;;

let rec length l =
  match l with
  | EmptyList -> 0
  | SomeElement (x, l) -> 1 + length l;;
- val length : int_list -> int = <fun>

Same as:
let rec length = function
  | EmptyList -> 0
  | SomeElement (element, sublist) -> 1 + length sublist;;
- val length : int_list -> int = <fun>

```

------------------------------------------------------------
## A Predefined type for Lists

Lists are so important in FP, that there is a type for lists.

The type for lists of elements of type t is defined as: t list

The empty list is written: []

[] is a special TAG.

It corresponds to EmptyList in the previous example.

An integer "i" followed by the rest of the list "r" is written: i :: r

:: is a special TAG, corresponding to SomeElement

A list can be defined by enumeration:
```
[ some_expression; ... ; some_expression ];;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Length of list, using the predefined tags
```ocaml
let rec length = function
  | [] -> 0
  | x :: xs -> 1 + length xs;;
- val length : 'a list -> int = <fun>
- NOTE: this list is now a GENERIC list

let three = length [1; 2; 3; ];;
```
------------------------------------------------------------
## Reverse a list
```ocaml
let rec reverse = function
  | [] -> []
  | x :: xs -> reverse xs @ [ x ];;

  - we are CONCATENATING the HEAD of the original list to the REST of the original list
  - we get a function "from list" "to list"

let l = reverse [1; 2; 3; ];;
```



Note that we are concatenating 2 lists, and the cost of this is linear in the
size of the first list. So what we get in the end is a QUADRATIC EQUATION (?!!!)


That is a costly function, so let's refactor

This is called "ACCUMULATION PASSING STYLE" in FP...

The idea is that we add an extra argument "accu" that will contain the final
result of the computation.



```ocaml
let rec reverse_aux accu = function
  | [] -> accu
  - ie. when we have finished traversing the list (we have an empty list)

  | x :: xs -> reverse_aux (x :: accu) xs;;
  - when we have a non-enpty list, with "x" as the HEAD,
  - we push that element "x" to the top of the list "accu" and we do a
    recursive call to the rest of the list...

  - this has the advantage of being linear in the size of the list.
  - because we traverse the INPUT LIST ("x"), and at each step, we only
    do a CONSTANT TIME OPERATION ("::"), where we construct a list with "::"
    with "x" and the "accu"

let reverse l = reverse_aux [] l;;

let l = reverse [1; 2; 3;];;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
You don't only have to have 2 cases when you define a function
by recursion of a list:

```ocaml
let rec uniq = function
  | [] -> []
  | [x] -> [x]
  | x :: x' :: xs ->
    if x = x' then
      uniq (x' :: xs)
    else
      x :: uniq (x' :: xs);;

let l1 = uniq [1;2;2;3;4;3];;
- val l1 : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 3]



```
------------------------------------------------------------
## The @ operator
The "@" operator is an infix operator.
It is the same as Array.append
```ocaml
# [] @ [];;
- : 'a list = []

# [1] @ [2];;
- : int list = [1; 2]
```
------------------------------------------------------------
## The :: operator
```
# [] :: [];;
- : 'a list list = [[]]

# [1]::[1];;
Error: This expression has type int but an expression was expected of type
         int list

# 1 :: [1];;
- : int list = [1; 1]

```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Quiz: First in, First Out
Queues are a standard FIFO structure.

In this exercise, we implement a queue with a pair of two lists (front, back)
such that front @ List.rev back represents the sequence of elements in the
queue.

Write a function is_empty : queue -> bool such that is_empty q is true if and only if q has no element.
```ocaml
let is_empty = function
  | [] -> true
  | [x] -> false;;
Warning 8: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a case that is not matched:
_::_::_
val is_empty : 'a list -> bool = <fun>


let is_empty = function
  | [] -> true
  | _ -> false;;
Wrong type 'a list -> bool.

We need queue -> bool

type queue = int list * int list;;

let is_empty (front, back) =
  if List.length back = 0 then true
  else false;;


NB. Straight of the bat, we use LIST:
# let x = [1;2;3;4];;
val x : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4]

```
Solution:
```ocaml
let is_empty (front, back) =
  if (List.length back = 0 || List.length front = 0) then true
  else false;;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
Write a function enqueue : int -> queue -> queue
such that enqueue x q is the queue as q except that x is at the end of the queue.

```ocaml
type queue = int list * int list;;
type enqueue = int -> queue -> queue;;

let enqueue int queue =
  queue @ [int];;

let enqueue x (front, back) =
  front::back @ [x];;

# enqueue 34 (0, [1;2;3]);;
- : int list = [0; 1; 2; 3; 34]

- Wrong type 'a -> 'a * 'a list -> 'a list.

let enqueue x (front, back) =
  front::back :: x;;
Wrong type 'a list -> 'a * 'a -> 'a list.

let enqueue x (front, back) = (front::back) @ x;;

let enqueue x (front, back) = (front, back) @ x;;

let enqueue x (head, tail) =
  let existing = head :: tail in
  existing :: x;;

let enqueue x (head, tail) = (head :: tail, x);;
Wrong type 'a -> 'b * 'b list -> 'b list * 'a.

let enqueue x (head, tail) = (head, tail::x);;

let enqueue x (front, back) = (front :: List.hd back, List.tl :: x);;

  # ([1], [2]);;
- : int list * int list = ([1], [2])

let enqueue x q = q :: x;;

In this exercise, we implement a queue with a pair of two lists (front, back) such that front @ List.rev back represents the sequence of elements in the queue.

This is a queue of a PAIR of two LISTS
[1;2;3], [3;2;1]
int list * int list

type queue = int list * int list

let enqueue x (front_list, back_list) = (front_list :: x, x :: back_list);;

# let enqueue x (front_list, back_list) = (front_list :: x, x :: back_list);;
val enqueue : 'a list -> 'a * 'a list list -> 'a list * 'a list list = <fun>

# let enqueue x (front_list, back_list) = (front_list @ x, x @ back_list);;
val enqueue : 'a list -> 'a list * 'a list -> 'a list * 'a list = <fun>

# let enqueue (x: int) (front_list, back_list) = (front_list :: [x], [x] @ back_list);;
val enqueue : int -> int * int list -> int list * int list = <fun>

# let enqueue (x: int) (front_list, back_list) = (front_list @ [x], [x] @ back_list);;
val enqueue : int -> int list * int list -> int list * int list = <fun>

THIS IS NOW THE RIGHT TYPE:
# let enqueue x (front_list, back_list) = (front_list @ [x], [x] @ back_list);;
val enqueue : 'a -> 'a list * 'a list -> 'a list * 'a list = <fun>


enqueue -4 ([3; -1; 4; -4; -1; 3; -4], [3; 3; 3; -2; -3])

let enqueue (x: int) (first, second) = (first, second @ [(x)]);;
let enqueue x (first, second) = (first, second @ [(x)]);;

let enqueue (x: int) (first, second) = (first, x @ List.rev second );;
let enqueue (x: int) (first, second) = (first, x :: List.rev second );;
let enqueue (x: int) (first, second) = (first, List.rev second @ [x]);;
let enqueue (x: int) (first, second) = (first, [x] @ List.rev second );;


OMG THIS IS IT.
let enqueue (x: int) (first, second) = (first, x :: second  );;
- we are simply using "x" as the head, and sticking "second" onto it...

```

------------------------------------------------------------
Write a function `split : int list -> int list * int list`

such that
`split l = (front, back)` where `l = back @ List.rev front`

and the length of `back` and `front`
is `List.length l / 2` or `List.length l / 2 + 1`

```ocaml
let split (l: int list) =


let rec take n list =
  match list with
  | [] -> []
  | x :: rest ->
    if x = n then [x]
    else list;;

let rec take n list =
  match list with
  | [] -> []
  | [x] -> [x]
  | head :: rest  ->
    let reversed = List.rev rest in
    let [last :: rest] = reversed in
    List.rev rest
  ;;

let rec take n list =
  match list with
  | [] -> []
  | [x] -> [x]
  | head :: rest  ->
    let reversed = List.rev rest in
    let [last :: rest] = reversed in
    List.rev rest
  ;;

take 2 [1;2;3];;

```

------------------------------------------------------------
Write a function dequeue : queue -> int * queue such that dequeue q = (x, q')
where x is the front element of the queue q and q' corresponds to remaining
elements. This function assumes that q is non empty.

```ocaml
let dequeue q =
  match q with
  | [] -> (0, [])
  | [x] -> (x, [])
  | [x;y] -> (x, [y])
  | _ ->
    let h::rest = q in
    (h, rest);;

# let a::b = [];;
Warning 8: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a case that is not matched:
[]
Exception: Match_failure ("//toplevel//", 714, -77).
#

let dequeue q =
  match q with
  | [] -> (0, [])
  | h::rest -> (h, rest)
  ;;

let dequeue q =
  match q with
  | [] -> ([], [])
  | h::rest -> ([h], rest)
  ;;

let dequeue (front, back) =
  match (front, back) with
  | _ ->
    let h::rest = front in
    (h, rest @ back);;

let enqueue (x: int) (first, second) = (first, x :: second  );;

let dequeue queue =
  match queue with
  | _ ->
    let (front, back) = queue in
    let h::rest = front in
    (h, rest @ back);;

let dequeue (front, back) =
  match (front, back) with
  | ([], back) ->
    let h::rest = back in
    (h, ([], back))
  | _ ->
      let h::rest = front in
      (h, (rest, back));;

let dequeue (front, back) =
  match (front, back) with
  | ([], back) ->
    let a::b::rest = back in
    (a, ([b], rest))
  | _ ->
      let h::rest = front in
      (h, (rest, back));;

let dequeue (front, back) =
  match (front, back) with
  | ([], back) ->
    let a::rest = back in
    (a, ([], rest))
  | _ ->
      let h::rest = front in
      (h, (rest, back));;

dequeue ([], [3; 2; 1]);;

```
------------------------------------------------------------

## Classic Functions over lists
Write a function
mem : int -> int list -> bool
such that mem x l is true if and only if x occurs in l

```ocaml
let rec mem x list = List.mem x list;;


let rec mem x list =
  match x, list with
  | _, [] -> false
  | x, head::rest ->
    if x = head then true
    else mem x rest;;

```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Append
Write a function append: int list -> int list
such that append 11 12 is the concatenation of 11 and 12

```ocaml
let rec append list1 list2 =
  match list1, list2 with
  | _, [] -> list1
  | list1, h::rest -> append (list1 @ [h]) rest;;

let rec append = function
  | list1, [] -> list1
  | list1, h::rest -> append (list1 @ [h]) rest;;
Error: This expression has type 'a -> 'b
       but an expression was expected of type 'c list

let rec append = function (list1, list2)
  | list1, [] -> list1
  | list1, h::rest -> append list1 rest;;
Error: Variable list2 must occur on both sides of this | pattern

let rec append = function
  | list1, [] -> list1
  | list1, h::rest -> append (list1, rest);;
val append : 'a * 'b list -> 'a = <fun>

let rec append = function
  | list1, [] -> list1
  | list1, h::rest -> append (list1 @ [h], rest);;
val append : 'a list * 'a list -> 'a list = <fun>
but append [1] [2] doesn't work....

Note that

 let f = function ...

is strictly equivalent to

 let f x = match x with ...

```

```ocaml
let rec append = function
  | list1, [] -> list1
  | list1, list2 ->
    let h::rest = list2 in
    append (list1 @ [h]) rest;;

Error: This expression has type 'a -> 'b
       but an expression was expected of type 'c list

let rec append = function
  | list1, [] -> list1
  | list1, list2 ->
    let h::rest = list2 in
    append list1 rest;;

function only defines unary functions
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Combine
Write a function combine: int list -> int list -> (int * int) list
such that combine list1 list2 is the list of pairs obtained by joining
the elements of list1 and list2

This function assumes that list1 and list2 have the same length:

combine [1;2] [3;4] = [(1,3); (2,4)]

```ocaml
let rec combine l1 l2 =
  match l1, l2 with
  | _ -> l1;;

let rec combine l1 l2 =
  match l1, l2 with
  | h::t, a::b ->
    if List.length t = 1 && List.length b = 1 then [(h,a); (t,b)]
    else [(1,2); (3,4)];;

let rec combine l1 l2 =
  match l1, l2 with
  | _ -> [(1,2); (3,4)];;

combine [1;2] [3;4];;
combine [1;2;3] [3;4;5];;

let add_pair res a b =
  List.append res [(a,b)];;

let rec combine list1 list2 result = function
  | [] [] [] -> result
  ;;
Error: The constructor [] expects 0 argument(s),
       but is applied here to 1 argument(s)

let rec combine list1 list2 result =
  match list1, list2, result with
  | [], [], _ -> result
  | list1, list2, result ->
    let list1_head::list1_tail = list1 in
    let list2_head::list2_tail = list2 in
    let r2 = result @ [(list1_head, list2_head)] in
    combine list1_tail list2_tail r2
  ;;

#trace combine;;
combine [1;2] [3;4] [];;
#untrace_all;;

Warning 8: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a case that is not matched:
(([], [], _::_)|([], _::_, _)|(_::_, _, _))

ie.
empty, empty, list
empty, list, list
list, list, list

```

```ocaml
let rec combine list1 list2 =
  let rec aux list1 list2 result =
    match list1, list2, result with
    | [], [], _ -> result
    | list1, list2, result ->
        let list1_head::list1_tail = list1 in
        let list2_head::list2_tail = list2 in
        let r2 = result @ [(list1_head, list2_head)] in
        aux list1_tail list2_tail r2
  in aux list1 list2 [];;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Assoc
Write a function assoc: (string * int) list -> string -> int option
such that
assoc list k = Some x if (k,x) is the first pair of list whose first component is k

If no such pair exists, assoc list k = None

```ocaml
let rec assoc list key =
  match list, key with
  | _ -> None;;

(* (string, int) list *)
let rec assoc list key =
  let first::tail = list in
  let (s, i) = first in
  if s = key then Some i
  else None;;

let rec assoc list key =
  match list, key with
  | [], _ -> None
  | list, key ->
    let first::tail = list in
    let (s, i) = first in
    if s = key then Some i
    else assoc tail key;;

let rec assoc list key =
  match list, key with
  | [], _ -> None
  | first::tail, key ->
    let (s, i) = first in
    if s = key then Some i
    else assoc tail key;;

assoc [("as", 47); ("when", 66); ("done", 24); ("and", 53)] "when";;

# List.assoc "when" [("as", 47); ("when", 66); ("done", 24); ("and", 53)];;
- : int = 66
