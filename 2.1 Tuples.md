# Tuples: Constructing and Observing Tuples

## Composite values
- Some values are NATURALLY made of several components
- Example: a citizen identification = a name, a firstname, a social security
  number
- A 2D coordinate = an abscissa, an ordinate
  - abscissa = x-coordinate
  - ordinate = y-coordinate
- How can we construct and observe composite values?

------------------------------------------------------------
```ocaml
(* this is a PAIR, a tuple of size 2 *)
let origin = (0, 0);;
- the inferred type is:
val origin : int * int = (0, 0)

let x_positive_limit = (max_int, 0);;

let x_negative_limit = (min_int, 0);;

```
------------------------------------------------------------
We can also do that using type identifier:
```ocaml
type point2D = int * int;;

let origin : point2D = (0, 0);;

let x_positive_limit : point2D = (max_int, 0);;

let x_negative_limit : point2D = (min_int, 0);;
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Syntax for tuple construction
- The TYPE CONSTRUCTOR "*" constructs tuple types:
- we are COMPOSING a tuple type by combining other types

some_type * ... * some_type

- A tuple is constructed by separating its components with a comma
(some_expression, ..., some_expression)

- How to observe the components of a tuple?

------------------------------------------------------------
## Pattern matching
- Patterns describe HOW values are OBSERVED by the program
- patterns appear in
  - let bindings
  - as function arguments

- we have already seen the simplest form of pattern: identifiers

let x = 6 * 3 in x

can be read:
"I observe the value of 6 * 3 by naming it x"
- "when i see "6 * 3" then i know it's x"

- There is another way to observe a value: to ignore it using a wildcard pattern

let _ = 6 * 3 in 1
- this returns : int = 1
- we are saying "evaluate 6 * 3, but don't store it, then return 1


I ignore the value of 6 * 3

------------------------------------------------------------
Patterns can be composed to describe the observation of tuples:

let (x, _) = (6 * 3, 2) in x;;
- "I observe the first component of (6 * 3, 2) by naming it x"
- "I ignore the second component of (6 * 3, 2)"

------------------------------------------------------------
```ocaml
let a = (3 * 6, 4 * 6);;

let (x, _) = a;;
- val x : int = 18

let abscissa (x, _) = x;;
- this is a function definition
- val abscissa : 'a * 'b -> 'a = <fun>

let ordinate (_, y) = y;;
- this is also a function definition
- val ordinate : 'a * 'b -> 'b = <fun>

```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Syntax for tuple patterns
- a pattern that matches a tuple has the form:
(some_pattern, ..., some_pattern)
- all we need to do is to write ONE PATTERN for EACH COMPONENT

let x = 9
    ^   ^ component
    pattern

let (a, b) = (0, 1);;
     ^  ^ subpattern 2
     ^ subpattern 1

val a : int = 0
val b : int = 1


- the only constraint: the number of SUBPATTERNS must be equal to the number of
  TUPLE COMPONENTS

- an identifier can only occur ONCE in a pattern

------------------------------------------------------------
## In the machine

- A tuple is represented by a HEAP-ALLOCATED BLOCK
- a block in memory with several cells inside it, with ONE CELL per COMPONENT of
  the tuple

```
    Program                   Machine

    let p = (1,2,3)           [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]
                              ^
                              we have a block with 3 cells
                              we also have an identiier "p" that represents the VALUE of the tuple
                              the program holds a POINTER to this block

    let q = (p, 0)            [ ^^ ] [ 0 ]
                                ^
                                In memory, this first cell of this pair is in fact a POINTER
                                to the first block!
```

- this pointer can be SHARED
let q = (p, p)
- now we have 2 pointers, and the second pointer is pointing to the same memory block

------------------------------------------------------------
## Structural equality vs physical equality
- there are 2 kinds of equality in OCaml
  - structural
  - physical

- in OCaml, the operator "=" implements STRUCTURAL EQUALITY

- 2 values are STRUCTURALLY equal if they have the same CONTENT

- the operator "==" implements PHYSICAL EQUALITY

- 2 values are PHYSICALLY equal if they are stored in the SAME MEMORY LOCATION

- [??] so == is a subset of = ?

------------------------------------------------------------
```ocaml

let x = (1, 2);;
- val x : int * int = (1, 2)

let y = (1, 2);;
- val y : int * int = (1, 2)

let z = x;;
- val z : int * int = (1, 2)

let is_x_structurally_equal_to_y = (x = y);;
- true
- contents are equal

let is_x_physically_equal_to_y = (x == y);;
- false
- different blocks in memory have been allocated, different addresses

let is_x_physically_equal_to_z = (x == z);;
- true
- same block in memory
- z is sharing the same pointer as x
- same address in memory
```

------------------------------------------------------------
## Pitfalls: Ill-formed patterns

- Invalid arity
  - arity: number of arguments
  - ie. not enough, or too many subpatterns
  - wrt the number of components of the tuple that we are analyzing
  - let (x, _) = (1, 2, 3)

- Non-linear patterns
  - can't use the same identifer in a pattern
  - this is called "non-linear"
  - let (x, x, y) = (1, 2, 3)
  - variable x is bound several times in this matching

- these errors are caught by the compiler!

------------------------------------------------------------
## Pitfall: Semantically invalid projection
- definition-by-position is error-prone
  - cannot be caught by the compiler because it is a semantic problem

let abscissa = (x, y) = y;;

- this is well-typed, BUT the compiler can't know that...

- another type, RECORDS, will help us avoid such errors!
